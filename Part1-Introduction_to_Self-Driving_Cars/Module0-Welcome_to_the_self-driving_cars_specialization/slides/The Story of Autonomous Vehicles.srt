00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,940
Hello everyone. Welcome to
this video in which we roll through

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,650
the many major milestones in

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,570
the rapidly evolving story
of self-driving cars.

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,450
A driverless future seems
just around the corner,

5
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,590
but it's been a long arduous journey
to arrive at this point.

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,325
The dream of self-driving cars is
almost as old as the automobile.

7
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:31,200
As early as 1925,

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,175
Francis Udina demonstrated
a remote control car

9
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:35,570
called the American wonder,

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,650
which drove through the streets of

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,650
Manhattan frightening passerbys
with an empty driver's seat.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,705
Udina, a local mechanic,

13
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:45,005
is not to be confused
with Harry Houdini,

14
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:46,640
the famous escape artist,

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,220
who was rather upset and
started an altercation

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,295
when people accidentally
attributed the marvel to him.

17
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:56,150
The self-driving car dream
was alive and well in 1956,

18
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,750
as GM or at least a promotional
video cleaning self-driving cars

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,165
would arrive by 1976.

20
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:03,985
In the key to the future,

21
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:07,115
GM saw humans handing over
control on the highway,

22
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:09,140
enjoying a stress-free drive,

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,970
and the passengers
even interacting with

24
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,640
the car in voice activated
control features.

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,995
A little optimistic,
but in terms of timing,

26
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:18,020
it's amazing how many of these videos

27
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,390
predictions are now becoming
available in the market.

28
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,730
This dreams inspiration come

29
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,180
straight from the reality
of driving in busy traffic.

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,090
There is no doubt that one of
the most dangerous things we

31
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,255
do on a regular basis
is driving our car.

32
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:34,730
In fact, more than 94 percent of

33
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,110
all driving accidents today are

34
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,300
caused by some kind of human error.

35
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,420
What if we could minimize or
completely eliminate driving

36
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,145
deaths by taking human error

37
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,890
out of the picture
through automation?

38
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,330
There are also
many other profound benefits

39
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,430
that could arise from
a driverless future.

40
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,590
Instead of focusing on lanes, turns,

41
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,090
and traffic, you can
reply to work emails.

42
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,130
Eat or relax and make the morning
so much more productive.

43
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,380
We can extend
the mobility the driving

44
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,005
provides to the entire
human population,

45
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:05,920
not just those able to
perform the driving task.

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,440
Let's go back to the beginning
of the self-driving car story,

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,400
and take a look at the milestones
that have defined this industry,

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,450
at the breakthroughs that
make it all seem possible,

49
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,280
and at the setbacks that
remind us how ambitious

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,260
this vision of ubiquitous
autonomy really is.

51
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,020
Our journey starts out with

52
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,095
some early advances in
Europe in the 1980s.

53
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:28,730
Pioneers had been working on

54
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,610
self-driving technology
for over 40 years,

55
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,520
with early vehicles mostly partially

56
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,595
autonomous and operating
at low speeds.

57
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:41,060
In 1986, Ernst Dickens
and his team from

58
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,010
the University of Munich pioneer to

59
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,675
robotic van that could drive fully
autonomously without traffic,

60
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:50,900
and in 1987, it drove it speeds
up to 60 kilometers per hour.

61
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,340
In the early 1990s,

62
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,170
his team contributed significantly to

63
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,165
the Eureka Prometheus project,

64
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:58,910
and develop an autonomous
Daimler Benz using

65
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,070
psychotic computer vision that is

66
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,635
focusing on points of
interest in the environment.

67
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:05,690
They had over 50 transporters,

68
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,640
the latest microprocessors
of the day and the

69
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,980
same probabilistic
approaches used throughout

70
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,470
robotics on-board to few sensor input

71
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,370
and react to road
situations in real time.

72
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,820
Ultimately, the diamond bends drove

73
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,390
1,600 kilometers in
traffic from Munich to

74
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,670
Copenhagen with
a mean distance between

75
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,355
human intervention
of nine kilometers.

76
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:27,340
At the same time in the US,

77
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,650
Carnegie Mellon University's
Navlab was busy building

78
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,475
a steady series of prototypes
with ever-improving capabilities.

79
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:38,740
In 1986, there first
autonomous vehicle, Navlab1,

80
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,760
managed 30 kilometers per hour on

81
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,150
the road using
multiple sun workstations.

82
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,945
Then in 1990, Navlab2,

83
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:47,900
a modified Humvee which could perform

84
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,285
autonomously both off than on-road,

85
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:54,815
reached autonomous speeds of 110
kilometers per hour on the road.

86
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:57,080
This pushed the team
to attempt something

87
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,120
much more ambitious, and in 1996,

88
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,405
they completed their no hands
across America tour,

89
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:06,800
a 4,800 kilometer route
across the continent with

90
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,065
an impressive 98.2 percent
to autonomous driving.

91
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:14,420
Soon after, the UC Berkeley path
project rose to prominence with

92
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,600
successful demonstrations
of autonomous platoons of

93
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,420
vehicles operating on
dedicated HOV lanes on the I5.

94
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,735
In 1992, four vehicles drove
in convoy at highway speeds

95
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:29,030
relying on magnetic markers on

96
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,430
the roadway for
precise relative positioning,

97
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,800
and demonstrated that
using this kind of

98
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,890
convoy saves on fuel costs
and reduces wind drag.

99
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,890
Successful tests
continued and in 1997,

100
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,355
large scale demonstrations with

101
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:45,140
eight to 10 vehicles were completed.

102
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,420
The project also firmly
established the use of

103
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,400
radar systems and vehicle to

104
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,250
vehicle communications
in the AV industry,

105
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,335
leading to advances such as

106
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,825
adaptive cruise control
and emergency braking.

107
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:59,195
Then in 2002, DARPA,

108
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:02,255
the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency

109
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:04,720
announced the first of
its grand challenges.

110
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,960
That would forever change

111
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,395
the world's perception about
what autonomous robots can do.

112
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:13,070
The first event was held
in 2004 and DARPA offered

113
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,975
the winners a one
million dollar prize

114
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:16,970
if they could build
an autonomous vehicle,

115
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,885
that was able to navigate 142
miles through the Mojave Desert.

116
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:22,460
Although the first event saw

117
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,875
only a few teams get
off the start line

118
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,930
and Carnegie Mellon's red team taking

119
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,450
first-place haven't
driven only seven miles,

120
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,785
it was clear that the task of driving

121
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:33,740
140 miles through the desert without

122
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,365
any human aid was indeed possible.

123
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:39,545
In the second DARPA grand
challenge the next year,

124
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:43,550
five of the 23 teams
smashed expectations and

125
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,260
successfully completed the track

126
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,510
without any human
intervention at all.

127
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,400
Stanford's vehicle stanley won

128
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,535
the challenge followed by
Carnegie Mellon Sandstorm.

129
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:55,355
The era of driverless
cars had arrived.

130
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,740
Later, the 2007 installment
called the DARPA Urban Challenge,

131
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,640
invited universities to show off

132
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,470
their autonomous vehicles on

133
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,005
busy roads with
professional stunt drivers.

134
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:08,570
This time, after
a harrowing 30-minute delay when

135
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,580
the jumbotron screen block

136
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,920
their vehicle from
receiving GPS signals,

137
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,289
the Carnegie Mellon team
came out on top,

138
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:18,110
with Stanford Junior vehicle
coming in second.

139
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,210
The three grand challenges were truly

140
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,960
a watershed moment in the
development of self-driving cars,

141
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,200
changing the way the public and
more importantly the tech and

142
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,180
automotive industries thought about

143
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,805
the feasibility of
full vehicle autonomy.

144
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:33,170
It was now clear that

145
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,910
a massive new market was opening
up, and the race was on.

146
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,410
Google immediately
brought the team leads

147
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,690
from both Carnegie Mellon
and Stanford,

148
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,090
Chris Thompson, and
Mike Monte-Carlo to

149
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,730
push their designs onto public roads.

150
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,530
By 2010, Google's car had logged
over 140 thousand miles in

151
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,380
California and later
wrote in a blog post

152
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,000
how they were confident on cutting

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,770
the number of traffic deaths by half.

154
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,430
Their pursuit of this ambitious goal
continues to this day with

155
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,740
the team having logged
over 10 million miles

156
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,420
as of October of 2018.

157
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,975
Around the same time as the first
autonomous testing in the US,

158
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:11,465
two orange vans from the viz lab

159
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:14,390
completed the international
autonomous challenge,

160
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,040
driving an entire route from

161
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,175
the University of Parma Italy
to Shanghai China,

162
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:20,630
which was about 15,000

163
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,635
kilometers with
minimal driver intervention.

164
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:26,060
A year later, Volvo demonstrated

165
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,190
their road train concept in which

166
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,560
one vehicle could control
several other vehicles behind it,

167
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,585
thereby reducing road congestion
and improving driver comfort.

168
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:39,230
Car drivers could choose
a lead truck to follow,

169
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,460
but the close following lead to

170
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,880
frequent vehicle damage in
low visibility in rainy conditions.

171
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,100
As the pace of
development accelerated,

172
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,080
more and more companies
were pushing for

173
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,630
a legal framework
for on-road testing.

174
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,020
In 2012, the Nevada Department
of Motor Vehicles issued

175
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,965
Google the first ever autonomous
vehicle testing license,

176
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:01,430
which meant they could now test
autonomously on public roads.

177
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,900
California is soon followed

178
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,420
suit with a mandated
requirement to publish

179
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,190
a variety of statistics on

180
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,830
the test performed and the rates
of human intervention.

181
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,400
In 2013, 125 years

182
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,960
after the first Bertha Benz car
was demonstrated for public use,

183
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,480
mercedes benz demonstrated
their self-driving capabilities

184
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,485
by covering the same 106
kilometer route autonomously.

185
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:28,280
With multiple players demonstrating
viable on-road demos,

186
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,130
public interest in
autonomous driving has taken off.

187
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,900
The consumer electronics show in

188
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,910
Nevada became the annual showcase for

189
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,785
the greatest self-driving tech and
the wildest vehicle redesigns.

190
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,020
About a year later,

191
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,275
Google demoed their firefly car,

192
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:44,270
a vehicle designed from
the ground up to be

193
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,435
autonomous at speeds up to
40 kilometers per hour.

194
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:49,460
With no steering wheel or pedals,

195
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,795
passengers can instead
sit back and relax and

196
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:56,425
only press one stop button
if they feel uncomfortable.

197
00:08:56,425 --> 00:09:00,360
By doing so, Google showed us what
the AV future could look like.

198
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,310
Tesla wasn't far behind.

199
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,990
Around the end of 2015,

200
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,360
they introduced their suite of

201
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,555
autonomous features into
the software called autopilot.

202
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:11,420
By 2016, they had
demonstrated how autopilot

203
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,440
could self park and could
be summoned by a button.

204
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,640
This represented
the largest deployment

205
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,800
that partially autonomous
features at the time,

206
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,870
and so Tesla quickly racking up

207
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,915
millions of kilometers
driven with their autopilot.

208
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:25,945
Inevitably however,

209
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:28,894
as the number of autonomous
miles driven expanded,

210
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:30,770
the first fatal accident involving

211
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,400
a Tesla Model S happened
in Florida in 2016.

212
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,000
This was caused by a simultaneous
failure of both Camera and

213
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,860
radar sensors to correctly

214
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,260
identify a left turning
transport truck,

215
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,475
and an inattentive driver used to
a car that takes care of itself.

216
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:48,830
This setback demonstrated
the dangers of

217
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,285
reliance on human monitoring
of self-driving systems.

218
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:56,030
Despite this setback,
progress continued unabated.

219
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,310
This was also the time the notion of

220
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,205
autonomous taxi fleets
were becoming popular.

221
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:04,985
The startups like Zoox and
nuTonomy leading the way.

222
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:07,610
In fact, nuTonomy taxis first

223
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,240
became operational in
Singapore in 2016.

224
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,955
Finally, we arrive at 2018.

225
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:18,050
The infamous Uber crash that claim
to pedestrians life in Arizona.

226
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,060
This incident sent
shock waves through

227
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,205
the autonomous vehicle
testing community,

228
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,410
with Uber stopping testing until

229
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,675
the details could be fully understood

230
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:28,760
through an independent
investigation by

231
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,510
the national highway traffic
safety administration.

232
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,920
We'll discuss this worrying case
in more detail in

233
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,050
the first course as an example of

234
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,915
the challenges that remain
in self-driving systems.

235
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:41,270
So, the story of the development of

236
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,250
autonomous vehicles is a story of

237
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,380
enormous successes as well as

238
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,080
setbacks that seemed to be
happening more often recently.

239
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,490
So, what is it that's driving

240
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,115
the increase in self-driving
accidents during testing?

241
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:54,470
First, the number of
miles being driven by

242
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,880
self-driving cars in
hard conditions is exploding.

243
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,455
So, the number of accidents
are bound to go up.

244
00:11:00,455 --> 00:11:04,595
In fact, way more recently
announced that as a fall 2018,

245
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:08,015
they've completed over 10 million
miles of autonomous driving.

246
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:11,990
The time between human interventions
continues to grow with

247
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,670
the most advanced systems traveling

248
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,270
thousands of kilometers without
any intervention at all.

249
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,630
Human level performance appears
to be just around the corner,

250
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,760
where the industry
needs more support than

251
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,490
ever to meet and exceed
this ambitious goal.

252
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,460
Many new and established
companies are pushing to

253
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,955
bring truly driverless cars
to market as early as 2020.

254
00:11:31,955 --> 00:11:35,185
The first large-scale deployments
will be in fleets,

255
00:11:35,185 --> 00:11:37,310
where companies own
the vehicles and provide

256
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,930
revolutionary new services like

257
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,780
robo taxis and driverless delivery.

258
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,390
The technology is
still quite expensive,

259
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,855
but prices will fall quickly as
economies of scale takeover.

260
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:50,330
So much still needs to
be done to bring about

261
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,310
the transformational
changes we expect

262
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,350
driverless cars to
bring to our society.

263
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,795
The industry will continue to need

264
00:11:56,795 --> 00:12:01,075
outstanding engineers to produce
innovative solutions for driving.

265
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:03,300
So I guess, the real question is,

266
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,140
are you ready to help shape
the future of personal mobility?
