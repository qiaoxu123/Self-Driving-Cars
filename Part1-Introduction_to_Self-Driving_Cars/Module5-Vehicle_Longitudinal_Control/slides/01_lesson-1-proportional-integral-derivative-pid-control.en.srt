00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,140
Welcome to week five of this course.

2
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,670
In the previous module,

3
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,250
you learned how to develop vehicle models to capture longitudinal and lateral dynamics.

4
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,010
In this module, we will go through the concepts of

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,795
longitudinal vehicle control to regulate the speed of our self-driving car.

6
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:39,080
Specifically, you'll review some of

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,730
the essential concepts from classical linear time-invariant control,

8
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,530
develop a PID control law for the longitudinal vehicle model and

9
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,660
combine feedforward and feedback control to improve desired speed tracking.

10
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,580
Design of the longitudinal speed control underpins all vehicle performance

11
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,335
on the road and is one of the fundamental components needed for autonomous driving.

12
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:07,100
In this video, we will briefly review some of the basics of

13
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,045
linear time-invariant control and the PID controller.

14
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:12,470
By the end of this video,

15
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:17,015
you'll be able to design a PID control for a linear time-invariant system.

16
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:20,090
Note that we will have to assume you're familiar with

17
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:25,150
classical control design including the use of transfer functions and the Laplace domain.

18
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,590
So, if you haven't seen these concepts before,

19
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,440
please check out some of the great controls courses on

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,135
Coursera listed in the supplemental materials. Let's get started.

21
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:37,395
In module three of this course,

22
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:38,660
we learned how to develop

23
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,160
the dynamic and kinematic models for a vehicle based on the bicycle model.

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,380
These models aim to capture how the dynamic system reacts to input commands from

25
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:54,410
the driver such as steering gas and break and how it reacts to disturbances such as wind,

26
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,930
road surface and different vehicle loads.

27
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:01,610
The effects of the inputs and disturbances on the states such as velocity and

28
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,070
rotation rate of the vehicle are defined

29
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,965
by the kinematic and dynamic models we developed.

30
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:09,530
The role of the controller then is to

31
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,950
regulate some of these states of the vehicle by sensing

32
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,635
the current state variables and then generating

33
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,160
actuator signals to satisfy the commands provided.

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,650
For longitudinal control, the controller sensing the vehicle speed and adjust

35
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,690
the throttle and break commands to match

36
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,285
the desired speed set by the autonomous motion planning system.

37
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:33,695
Let's take a look at a typical feedback control loop.

38
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,040
The plant or process model takes the actuator signals as

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,660
the input and generates the output or state variables of the system.

40
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,050
These outputs are measured by sensors and

41
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,280
estimators are used to fuse measurements into accurate output estimates.

42
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,470
The output estimates are compared to

43
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,214
the desired or reference output variables

44
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:57,875
and the difference or error is passed to the controller.

45
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,810
The controller can be seen as

46
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,950
a mathematical algorithm that generates actuator signals so that

47
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,350
the error signal is minimized and

48
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,310
the plant state variables approach the desired state variables.

49
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,035
The plant model be it linear or nonlinear can be represented in several ways.

50
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:18,215
Two of the most common ways are state-space form

51
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:21,530
which tracks the evolution of an internal state to connect

52
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,025
the input to the output and transfer function form

53
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:28,490
which models the input to output relation directly.

54
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,590
Note that for transfer functions,

55
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,485
the system must be linear and time-invariant.

56
00:03:33,485 --> 00:03:39,170
A transfer function G is a relation between inputs U and outputs Y of

57
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:45,320
the system defined in the Laplace domain as a function of S a complex variable.

58
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,500
We use the Laplace transform to go from

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,755
the time domain to the S domain because it allows for

60
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:54,740
easier analysis of an input-output relation

61
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,355
and is useful in understanding control performance.

62
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:00,515
When working with the transfer functions,

63
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:03,170
the numerator and denominator roots provide

64
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,715
powerful insight into the response of a system to input functions.

65
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:10,310
The zeros of a system are the roots of

66
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,525
the numerator and the poles of the system are the roots of its denominator.

67
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:20,720
Control algorithm design can vary from simple such as constant gain multiplication,

68
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,950
lookup tables and linear equations to more detailed methods based

69
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,435
on non-linear functions and optimization over finite prediction horizons.

70
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,540
Some of the basic and classic controllers include

71
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,270
lead-lag controllers and proportional integral and derivative or PID controllers.

72
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,900
In the rest of this video,

73
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,690
we will go into more detail on

74
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,955
the PID control combination as a useful starting point for longitudinal control.

75
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:50,255
More involved control design is also possible

76
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:53,570
and it's particularly useful for non-linear system models,

77
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,730
time-varying models, or models with constraints that limit output selection.

78
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,940
Nonlinear methods such as feedback linearization,

79
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,300
back stepping and sliding mode control are beyond the scope of

80
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,420
this course but can certainly be applied to self-driving vehicle control problem.

81
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,910
Optimization-based methods are heavily used in autonomous driving and so we'll look

82
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,370
at model predictive control as an example of

83
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,515
this group of controllers later on in the course.

84
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:24,580
PID control is mathematically formulated by

85
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,565
adding three terms dependent on the error function.

86
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:31,765
A proportional term directly proportional to the error E,

87
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:35,530
an integral term proportional to the integral of the error,

88
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,980
and a derivative term proportional to the derivative of the error.

89
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,350
The constants Kp, Ki,

90
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,400
and Kd are called

91
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,630
the proportional integral and derivative gains and govern the response so

92
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:53,185
the PID controller which is denoted U of t as it is the input to the plant model.

93
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:57,020
Taking the Laplace transform of the PID control yields

94
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,160
the transfer function Gc of S. Multiplying by

95
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,640
S in the Laplace domain is equivalent to taking a derivative in

96
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,245
the time domain and dividing by S is equivalent to taking the integral.

97
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:13,070
By adding these three terms of the PID controller together,

98
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,925
we get a single transfer function for PID control.

99
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:20,975
Note that not all gains need to be used for all systems.

100
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:24,200
If one or more of the PID gains are set to zero,

101
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,155
the controller can be referred to as P, Pd or Pi.

102
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,620
The PID transfer function contains

103
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,020
a single pole at the origin which comes from the integral term.

104
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:40,400
It also contains a second-order numerator with two zeros that can be

105
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,240
placed anywhere in the complex plane by selecting appropriate values for the gains.

106
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,820
PID control design therefore,

107
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,100
boils down to selecting zero locations to achieve

108
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:57,005
the desired output or performance based on the model for the plant.

109
00:06:57,005 --> 00:07:01,205
There are also several algorithms to tune PID gains,

110
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:04,715
among them, Ziegler Nichols is one of the most popular.

111
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:08,570
Closed loop response denotes the response of a system when

112
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,440
the controller decides the inputs to apply to the plant model.

113
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,820
For a step input on the reference signal we can define

114
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,515
the rise time as the time it takes to reach 90 percent of the reference value.

115
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:26,720
The overshoot as the maximum percentage the output exceeds this reference.

116
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,700
The settling time as the time to settle to within five percent of the reference

117
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,460
and the steady-state error as the error between

118
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,945
the output and the reference at steady-state.

119
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:40,380
The effects of each P,

120
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,165
I and D action are summarized in the following table.

121
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:49,310
For instance, an increase in Kp leads to a stronger reaction to

122
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,830
errors and therefore a decrease in

123
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,640
rise time in response to a step change in the reference signal.

124
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,720
Similarly, since Kd reacts to the rate of change of the error

125
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:06,350
an increased Kd leads to a decrease in overshoot or the rate of change of error is high.

126
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,580
It may simultaneously lead to a decrease in oscillations

127
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,130
about the reference and a decreased settling time as a result.

128
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,650
Finally, an increase in Ki can eliminate

129
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:23,770
steady-state errors but may lead to increased oscillation in the response.

130
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,910
Ultimately, the P, I and D gains must be selected with knowledge of

131
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,580
the interaction of their effects to adjust

132
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,420
the system response to get the right closed loop performance.

133
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,140
You'll get a chance to see these interactions as you develop

134
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,775
your own PID controller as part of the assessment for this course.

135
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,920
Now, let's take a look at

136
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,270
the well-known second-order spring-mass damper model as shown in the figure.

137
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,050
In this example, we'll first review the transfer function of

138
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,000
the proposed dynamic system and then design a PID controller for it.

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,760
The dynamics of the spring-mass damper system

140
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,400
were derived in an earlier video in this course.

141
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,790
The system is subjected to the input force F

142
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,945
and the output of the model is the displacement of the body x.

143
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:16,130
The mass M is connected to a rigid foundation by

144
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,480
a spring with spring constant K and a damper with damping coefficient b.

145
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,210
Now to transform the equation into the S domain or Laplace domain,

146
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:32,375
we use the Laplace transform and write the second-order equation as follows.

147
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,120
This relies on the fact that the derivative in

148
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,500
the time domain are multiplications by S in the Laplace domain.

149
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,910
Finally, the transfer function is formed which represents the relation

150
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,020
between the output x of s and the input F of S and is

151
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,340
defined as the plant transfer function G of s. This is

152
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,370
a second-order system with two poles defined by

153
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,955
the mass spring constant and damping coefficient.

154
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:01,400
To evaluate the system characteristics,

155
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,850
we excite the system by using a unit step input.

156
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:10,160
This is normally the first step to evaluate the dynamic characteristics of a plant.

157
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,880
For example, the system response x is plotted

158
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,650
here for the parameter values given as m equals one,

159
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,155
b equals 10 and k equals 20.

160
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:24,020
This type of response is easily generated with

161
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,665
scientific computing tools such as Matlab recite pi.

162
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:33,815
The input is the unit step F equals one and the output is once again x.

163
00:10:33,815 --> 00:10:37,115
This response is called the open-loop response

164
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:40,760
since there is no controller applied to the system at this point.

165
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,930
If a controller is added to the plant and the output of the model

166
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,960
is measured and compared with the desired output or reference signal,

167
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,850
then the response of the system is called the closed loop response.

168
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,300
For unity feedback, the sensor transfer function is

169
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,770
assumed to be one and in general it could be any transfer function.

170
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,550
The closed loop transfer function given here can be performed from

171
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,270
the transfer functions of the controller and the plant.

172
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,720
For those of you who have studied classical feedback control,

173
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,390
you'll know that the poles of the open-loop system

174
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,540
define the characteristics of the closed-loop response.

175
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,220
You may have also seen root locus bodhi and Nyquist design techniques which can

176
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,215
be used to select controllers that meet specific output specifications.

177
00:11:27,215 --> 00:11:30,200
We've left some links to appropriate resources for

178
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,835
those who'd like to learn more in the supplemental material.

179
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:38,300
Let's look at the step response for a few different PID controllers.

180
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,160
The dashed horizontal line represents the reference or desired output and

181
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,320
the controllers goal is to keep the actual output close to this reference.

182
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,939
In the first example,

183
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:54,890
the step responses for pure proportional control of the spring-mass damper system.

184
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,990
In the P controller response,

185
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,180
we see a fast rise time,

186
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,820
significant overshoot and prolonged oscillation leading to a long settling time.

187
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,125
Adding derivative control improves the step response in terms of

188
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:13,705
overshoot and settling time but slows down the rise time.

189
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:18,980
Adding the integral term instead maintains a short rise time and is

190
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:24,470
able to reduce oscillations and overshoot leading to a fast settling time as well.

191
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:29,855
The simple Pi control is an excellent design for the spring-mass damper system.

192
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:33,800
Including all three PID terms in the controller,

193
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,790
leads to even more flexibility in designing the step response.

194
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,220
By carefully tuning the controller gains,

195
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,160
we can use the benefits of all three to eliminate

196
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,900
overshoot and still maintain very short rise and settling times.

197
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,700
As can be seen in the plot,

198
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,400
the system approaches the reference at much more

199
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,575
quickly without any overshoot with PID control.

200
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,720
In this video, we've covered the concepts of

201
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,655
controller design and why we integrate controllers into a dynamic model.

202
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:08,510
We also reviewed the PID controller and learned how to control

203
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,590
the step response of a spring-mass damper system with PID control.

204
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,790
In the next video,

205
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,970
you will learn how to apply PID control to

206
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,150
regulate the speed of a self-driving car. See you there.
