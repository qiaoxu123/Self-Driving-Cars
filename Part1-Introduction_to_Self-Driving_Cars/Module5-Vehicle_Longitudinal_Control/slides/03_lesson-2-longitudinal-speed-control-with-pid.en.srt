00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,890
Welcome back. In the previous video,

2
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,545
we briefly reviewed the design of PID controllers and classical controller design.

3
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:27,630
In this video, we'll apply PID control to our longitudinal vehicle model.

4
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,615
So, by the end of this video, you'll be able to;

5
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:35,640
define the full vehicle planning and control architecture and design a

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,230
PID-based controller for regulating to a set reference speed as in cruise control.

7
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,720
Let's take a closer look at the vehicle control architecture

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,440
and how it fits into the overall autonomy software stack.

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,725
We can divide the structure into four sections.

10
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:54,215
These sections are connected to each other.

11
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:58,565
The first section is the perception of the road and the environment.

12
00:00:58,565 --> 00:01:04,790
This perception is captured by sensors and generates the input references for our system.

13
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,425
In the second layer,

14
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:10,399
we have both path generation and speed profile generation,

15
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:14,225
which in automotive circles is referred to as the drive cycle.

16
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:18,320
These profiles are generated through the motion planning process,

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,355
which is the focus of the fourth course of this specialization.

18
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:28,330
The path and the speed profiles are the reference inputs needed by our controllers.

19
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,525
For longitudinal control, define the set point's,

20
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:36,635
acceleration and deceleration that we'd like to be able to track precisely.

21
00:01:36,635 --> 00:01:41,300
For both the lateral and longitudinal control of an autonomous vehicle,

22
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,625
the only task that needs to be performed is to follow the plan as precisely as possible,

23
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:51,610
and thereby minimize the error between the actual and reference path and speed.

24
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:57,365
All other tasks required for autonomous driving or done by other parts of the system.

25
00:01:57,365 --> 00:02:03,545
Finally, the controllers generate the input commands or actuator signals for the vehicle.

26
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:05,960
As we've seen in the previous module,

27
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,850
these include the steering for

28
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,800
the lateral control and the throttle and break commands for longitudinal control.

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,565
Let's look at an example of longitudinal vehicle control.

30
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:20,765
One of the most well-known and commonly available control applications in

31
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:25,340
automotive control is cruise control operating at highway speeds.

32
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,280
A cruise control system performs the function of

33
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,610
maintaining a fixed reference speed using throttle commands,

34
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:37,460
and accelerating or decelerating to a new reference speed as requested by the driver.

35
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,855
When the vehicle is subjected to different loads and resistances,

36
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:45,805
the throttle angle will be changed by the cruise controller accordingly.

37
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:51,410
Many systems now exist with expanded capabilities such as the adaptive cruise control,

38
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,350
which can vary the reference point based on measurements of

39
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,350
a lead vehicle and semi autonomous systems,

40
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,890
like traffic jam assist,

41
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,530
which can operate throughout

42
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,000
the vehicle speed range and create spacing gaps for merging vehicles.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,270
These extended examples require additional controller

44
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,870
designed to handle the wider range of operating points.

45
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,910
This block diagram shows the cruise controller and plant vehicle model as

46
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,160
a closed loop system designed to keep

47
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,325
the vehicle velocity close to the reference velocity.

48
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:25,490
The controller can be split into two levels;

49
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,070
a high level and a low level controller.

50
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,420
Although the low level controller is not essential to the control task.

51
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,210
The high level controller takes the difference between

52
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,009
the set point velocity and the vehicle actual velocity,

53
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:43,220
and generates the desired vehicle acceleration to close the gap.

54
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,090
The low-level controller gets the vehicle acceleration and

55
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,025
generates a throttle or breaking actuation to track the reference acceleration.

56
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:58,430
In practice, this two-stage approach allows us to go beyond just PID control and impose

57
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,470
limits or profiles directly on

58
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,955
the accelerations that are requested of the vehicle in order to maintain speed.

59
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:07,925
It also allows us to separate the use of

60
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:10,820
engine maps we studied in the previous module for

61
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,100
generating a desired torque given

62
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,700
the engine state from the cruise control input response.

63
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,725
Let's take a closer look at the high level controller.

64
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:24,679
The upper level or high level controller determines

65
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:29,815
how much acceleration is needed at each time step based on the velocity error.

66
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:32,395
Let's apply a PID controller here,

67
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:35,015
which is expressed in the continuous time domain.

68
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:38,760
The input to the high level controller is the velocity error,

69
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,200
and the output is the vehicle's desired acceleration.

70
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,560
In the previous lesson,

71
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,280
we learned how to design a PID controller and studied

72
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,745
how the different gains affect performance of the controller.

73
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:52,549
To implement such a controller in software,

74
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:54,630
we discretize the controller,

75
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,405
changing the integral to a summation over a fixed length time steps.

76
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:03,500
The derivative term can be approximated with the finite difference over

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,120
a fixed time step if

78
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,520
either the reference acceleration or the estimated vehicle acceleration is not available.

79
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,650
The low-level controller generates the throttle and breaking signals to

80
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,690
follow the desired acceleration calculated by the high-level controller.

81
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,200
In designing a low-level controller,

82
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,495
we make some assumptions to simplify our problem.

83
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:29,510
We assume that only throttle is needed to

84
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,485
manage the speed of the vehicle during cruise control,

85
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:37,100
and that the driver will take over if breaking is required to avoid an incident.

86
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,190
We assume that we are operating in gear three or

87
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,070
higher such that the torque converter is locked,

88
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,230
meaning that torque from the engine passes

89
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,635
directly through the transmission without loss,

90
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:52,130
and we assume that the tire slip angle and ratio are

91
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,405
negligible as cruise control motions are typically gentle.

92
00:05:56,405 --> 00:06:00,770
The low-level controllers seeks to generate the desired acceleration from

93
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:06,080
the high level controller by increasing or decreasing the torque produced by the engine.

94
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,840
This is controlled by the throttle angle,

95
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,350
but is governed by the power train dynamics and the engine map,

96
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,120
making it a nonlinear problem that can be a challenge for classic control methods.

97
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,935
Instead, the desired acceleration is translated to a torque demand,

98
00:06:21,935 --> 00:06:25,940
and the torque demand is then converted to a throttle angle command.

99
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,910
Recall from the previous module that we developed

100
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,910
a second-order ordinary differential equation to

101
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,910
describe the acceleration of the vehicle in

102
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,200
terms of the difference between the engine torque and the load torque.

103
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,610
We can rearrange this equation to solve for the desired engine torque,

104
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,065
given known load torques and the desired acceleration of the vehicle.

105
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:50,570
Then, the steady-state engine map,

106
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,040
which is generated in testing the engine at different operating points can be

107
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,500
used to determine the throttle angle needed to

108
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,635
produce the amount of torque demand required.

109
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:02,660
In these standard maps,

110
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,210
the desired engine torque and the current engine

111
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,450
RPM define the required throttle position,

112
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,940
and can be interpolated if needed.

113
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,210
This approach is a data-driven approximation,

114
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,325
but it works quite well in practice.

115
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:19,370
The approximation comes from the fact that the data points

116
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,280
in the map are steady-state points while

117
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,800
the power train is continuously changing

118
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,945
its operating point to meet the current driving conditions.

119
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:32,630
Finally, we can put the pieces of our vehicle controller

120
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,480
together and simulate the control response to

121
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,100
a step change in desired speed of our dynamic vehicle models with PID controllers.

122
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:47,450
The PID gains are tuned by trial and error so that the vehicle speeds follow

123
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:52,555
the reference velocity of 30 meters per second or a 108 kilometers per hour.

124
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,680
In the results plot, on the left,

125
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,265
we see the throttle opening as a percentage,

126
00:07:58,265 --> 00:08:01,175
which is the commanded throttle for the vehicle.

127
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:04,990
On the right, we see how the actual velocity evolves over time,

128
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,740
and reaches the reference velocity after a settling time.

129
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,980
Because of the engine map non-linearity,

130
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,230
we see some interesting artifacts in

131
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,535
the vehicle response as it closes in on the reference speed.

132
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:21,170
You'll see even more interesting effects in

133
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:26,000
the simulated vehicles in Carla during your final assessment for this course,

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,805
with gear changes causing big challenges for pure PID control.

135
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:33,710
In this video, we covered the concept of

136
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,115
longitudinal speed control for a cruise control system.

137
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:40,130
This is the first case in designing a controller for

138
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,050
the autonomous car to follow a desired forward speed in this course.

139
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,730
We learned the concepts of high-level and low-level controllers and use

140
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,320
the combination of PID control and engine maps to regulate vehicle speed.

141
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,455
In the next video,

142
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:59,720
you will learn how to apply feed-forward control to improve

143
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,980
the performance of a longitudinal control system. See you there.
