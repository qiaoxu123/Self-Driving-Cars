00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,800
Welcome to the second video of this week.

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,770
We started out this week by covering the various kinds of

3
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,500
sensors most commonly used for perception.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,450
Now, let's learn how to place

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,305
these sensors to aggregate a complete view of the environment.

6
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:30,330
In this video, we will cover

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,720
the configuration design to meet sensor coverage needs for an autonomous driving car.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,110
We will do this by going through two common scenarios,

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,740
driving on a highway and driving in an urban environment.

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,960
After analyzing these scenarios,

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,795
we will lay out the overall coverage requirements

12
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:50,480
and discuss some issues with the design.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,325
Let's begin by recalling the most commonly available sensors from our last video.

14
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:58,040
These are the camera for appearance input.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,750
The stereo camera for depth information,

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,735
lidar for all whether 3D input,

17
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:06,240
radar for object detection,

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,990
ultrasonic for short-range 3D input and

19
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,875
GNSS/IMU data and wheel odometry for ego state estimation.

20
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,170
Also, remember that all of these sensors come in

21
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,180
different configurations and have

22
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,950
different ranges in fields of view over which they can sense.

23
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,690
They have some resolution that depends on the instrument specifics and field of view.

24
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,165
Before we move to discussing coverage,

25
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:35,360
let's define the deceleration rates we're willing to accept for

26
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,905
driving which will drive the detection ranges needed for our sensors.

27
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:45,020
Aggressive deceleration are set at five meters per second squared which is roughly

28
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,020
the deceleration you experience when you slam the brakes hard

29
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,410
and try to stop abruptly in case of an emergency.

30
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,320
Normal decelerations are set to two meters per second squared,

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,310
which is reasonably comfortable while still allowing the car to come to a stop quickly.

32
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:06,125
Given a constant deceleration our braking distance d can be computed as follows.

33
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:09,230
D is equal to v squared over 2a,

34
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,910
where V is the vehicle velocity and a is its rate of deceleration.

35
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,640
We can also factor in reaction time of the system and road surface friction limits,

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,115
but we'll keep things simple in this discussion.

37
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:24,425
Let's talk about coverage now.

38
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:27,800
The question we want to answer is where should we place

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,630
our sensors so that we have sufficient input for our driving task?

40
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,440
Practically speaking, we want our sensors to capture the ODD we

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,415
have in mind or the ODD our system can produce decisions for.

42
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:45,065
We should be able to provide all of the decisions with sufficient input.

43
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:49,400
There can be so many possible scenarios in driving but we'll look at

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,545
just two common scenarios to see how the requirements drive our sensor selection.

45
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:57,560
Will look at highway and urban driving.

46
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,425
Let's think about these two situations briefly.

47
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:01,985
For a divided highway,

48
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:05,225
we have fast moving traffic, usually high volume,

49
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:07,415
and quite a few lanes to monitor,

50
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:10,670
but all vehicles are moving in the same direction.

51
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,000
The other highlight of driving on a highway setting is that there are

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,435
fewer and gradual curves and we have exits and merges to consider as well.

53
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:22,990
On the other hand, in the urban situation we'll consider,

54
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,180
we have moderate volume and moderate speed traffic with

55
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,520
fewer lanes but with traffic moving in all directions especially through intersections.

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,115
Let's start with the highway setting.

57
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:39,035
We can break down the highway setting into three basic maneuver needs.

58
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:43,250
We may need to hit the brakes hard if there's an emergency situation.

59
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,060
We need to maintain a steady speed matching the flow of traffic

60
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,105
around us and we might need to change lanes.

61
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,150
In the case of an emergency stop,

62
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,670
if there is a blockage on our road we want to stop in time.

63
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,925
So, applying our stopping distance equation longitudinally,

64
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:03,710
we need to be able to sense about a 110 meters in front of us assuming

65
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,915
a highway speed of a 120 kilometers and aggressive deceleration.

66
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,485
Most self-driving systems aim for sensing ranges of

67
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:16,315
a 150 to 200 meters in front of the vehicle as a result.

68
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:19,430
Similarly, to avoid lateral collision or to

69
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,030
change lanes to avoid hitting an obstacle in our lane,

70
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,360
we need to be able to sense at least our adjacent lanes,

71
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,900
which are 3.7 meters wide in North America.

72
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,280
To maintain speed during vehicle following,

73
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,950
we need to sense the vehicle in our own lane.

74
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,980
Both their relative position and the speed are

75
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,265
important to maintain a safe following distance.

76
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:42,980
This is usually defined in units of time for

77
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,480
human drivers and set to two seconds in nominal conditions.

78
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,960
It can also be assessed using aggressive deceleration of

79
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,835
the lead vehicle and the reaction time from our ego vehicle.

80
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:57,560
So, at a 120 kilometers per hour,

81
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,350
relative position and speed measurements to a range of

82
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:05,540
165 meters are needed and typical systems use 100 meters for this requirement.

83
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,280
Laterally, we need to know what's happening anywhere in our adjacent lanes in case

84
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,035
another vehicles seeks to merge into our lane or we need to merge with other traffic.

85
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:19,670
A wide 160 to 180 degree field of view is required to track

86
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:25,550
adjacent lanes and a range of 40 to 60 meters is needed to find space between vehicles.

87
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,980
Finally, let's discuss the lane change maneuver and consider the following scenario.

88
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,010
Suppose we want to move to the adjacent lane,

89
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,900
longitudinally we need to look forward,

90
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,720
so we are a safe distance from the leading vehicle and we also need to look behind just

91
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,955
to see what the rear vehicles are doing and laterally it's a bit more complicated.

92
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:50,195
We may need to look beyond just the adjacent lanes.

93
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:53,330
For example, what if a vehicle attempts

94
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,395
to maneuver into the adjacent lane at the same time as we do?

95
00:05:57,395 --> 00:06:02,030
We'll need to coordinate our lane change room maneuvers so we don't crash.

96
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,880
The sensor requirements for lane changes are roughly

97
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,910
equivalent to those in the maintain speed scenario.

98
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,030
As both need to manage vehicles in front of and

99
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,980
behind the ego vehicle as well as to each side.

100
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,720
Overall, this gives us the picture for

101
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,600
coverage requirements for the highway driving scenario.

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,260
We need longitudinal sensors and lateral sensors and

103
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,365
both wide field of view and narrow field of view sensors to do these three maneuvers,

104
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:33,620
the emergency stop, maintaining speed and changing lanes.

105
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,220
Already from this small set of ODD requirements we

106
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,615
see a large variety of sensor requirements that arise.

107
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:43,325
Let's discuss the urban scenario next.

108
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:46,850
The urban scenario as we discussed before is a moderate volume,

109
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,210
moderate traffic scenario with fewer lanes on

110
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,350
the highway case but with the added complexity of pedestrians.

111
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,530
There are six types of basic maneuvers here.

112
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,100
Obviously, we can still perform emergency stop,

113
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,220
maintain speed and lane changes but we

114
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,270
also have scenarios such as overtaking a parked car,

115
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,970
left and right turns at intersections and

116
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,585
more complex maneuvers through intersections such as roundabouts.

117
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:17,660
In fact, for the first three basic maneuvers,

118
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,210
the coverage analysis is pretty much the same as

119
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,630
the highway analysis but since we are not moving as quickly,

120
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,175
we don't need the same extent for our long-range sensing.

121
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:30,275
Let's discuss the overtake maneuver next.

122
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:35,225
More specifically, consider a case where you have to overtake a parked car.

123
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:38,780
Longitudinally, we definitely need to sense

124
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,250
the parked car as well as look for oncoming traffic.

125
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,810
So, we need both sensors,

126
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,420
wide short-range sensors to detect the parked car and

127
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:52,030
narrow long-range sensors to identify if oncoming traffic is approaching.

128
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,590
And laterally, we'll need to observe beyond

129
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,550
the adjacent lanes for merging vehicles as we did in the highway case.

130
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,325
For intersections, we need to have near

131
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:05,000
omni-directional sensing for all kinds of movements that can occur.

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,280
Approaching vehicles, nearby pedestrians,

133
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,410
doing turns and much more.

134
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,780
Finally, for roundabouts we need

135
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,525
a wide-range, short distance sensor laterally since the traffic is slow

136
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:20,660
but we also need a wide-range short distance sensor

137
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,905
longitudinally because of how movement around the roundabout occurs.

138
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:28,040
We need to sense all of the incoming traffic

139
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,660
flowing through the roundabout to make proper decisions.

140
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,855
And so we end up with this overall coverage diagram for the urban case.

141
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:37,610
The main difference with respect to

142
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,240
highway coverage is because of the sensing we require for

143
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,300
movement at intersections and at roundabouts and for the overtaking maneuver.

144
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,250
In fact, the highway case is almost entirely covered by the urban requirements.

145
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,250
Let's summarize the coverage analysis.

146
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,150
For all of the maneuvers we do,

147
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,835
we need long range sensors which typically have shorter angular field of view

148
00:09:01,835 --> 00:09:04,580
and wide angular field of view sensors which

149
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,985
typically have medium to short-range sensing.

150
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:10,700
As the scenarios become more complex,

151
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,600
we saw the need for full 360 degrees sensor coverage on

152
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,430
the short scale out to

153
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,745
about 50 meters and much longer range requirements in the longitudinal direction.

154
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:27,200
We can also add even shorter range sensors like sonar which are useful in

155
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,930
parking scenarios and so in

156
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,620
the end our sensor configuration looks something like this diagram.

157
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,250
To summarize, our choice of sensors should be driven by

158
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,210
the requirements of the maneuvers we want to execute and

159
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,490
it should include both long-range sensors for

160
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,190
longitudinal dangers and wide field of view sensors for omnidirectional perception.

161
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,970
The final choice of configurations also

162
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,030
depends on our requirements for operating conditions,

163
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,765
sensor redundancy due to failures and on budget.

164
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:03,395
There is no single answer to which sensors are needed for a self-driving car.

165
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:07,450
In this video, you learned how to select a hardware configuration by doing

166
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,790
sensor coverage analysis both for

167
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,290
longitudinal and lateral cases for highway and urban driving.

168
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,790
In the next video,

169
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,760
we'll study a modular software architecture for

170
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,780
a typical autonomous driving stack. See you then.
