[MUSIC]

3
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:18,313
In this lesson we'll take a closer
look at the maps created to represent

4
00:00:18,313 --> 00:00:20,370
the environment around our car.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,130
I'll present an overview of the three
different map types traditionally used for

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,880
autonomous driving, which you saw
briefly in the previous video.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,680
Then I'll give you a more detailed
explanation about each of the maps so you

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,060
can better understand How they're created
and used throughout the specialization.

9
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,760
The first map we will discuss
is the localization map.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,230
This map is created using
a continuous set of lidar points or

11
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,570
camera image features as the car
moves through the enviromment.

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,400
This map is then used in
combination with GPS, IMU and

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,270
wheel odometry by the localization module

14
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,210
To accurately estimate the precise
location of the vehicle at all times.

15
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,690
The second map is the occupancy grid map.

16
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,780
The occupancy grid also uses a continuous
set of LIDAR points to build a map of

17
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,470
the environment which indicates
the location of all static, or stationary,

18
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,020
obstacles.

19
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,480
This map is used to plan safe,
collision-free paths for

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,440
the autonomous vehicle.

21
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,040
The third and final map that we'll discuss
in this video is the detailed road map.

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,940
It contains detailed positions for

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,640
all regulatory elements,
regulatory attributes and lane markings.

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,440
This map is used to plan a path from the
current position to the final destination.

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,050
Let's take a closer look
at the localization map.

26
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,780
As I mentioned previously,

27
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,960
the localization map uses
recorded LIDAR points or

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,460
images, which are combined to make a point
cloud representation of the environment.

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,570
As new LIDAR camera data is received it
is compared to the localization map and

30
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,650
a measurement of the eagle vehicles
position is created by aligning the new

31
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,050
data with the existing map.

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,920
This measurement is then combined with
other sensors to estimate eagle motion and

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,599
ultimately used to control the vehicle

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,480
Here we have some recorded LIDAR
data from our self-driving car.

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,700
The movement of the vehicle is clear based
on the evolution of the LIDAR points

36
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,840
in this video.

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,920
As the car drives out of a driveway and
onto the street ahead.

38
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,250
This detailed evolving representation
of the motion of a car through its

39
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,990
environment Is extremely valuable for
the localization module.

40
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,080
The localization map can be quite large,
and many methods exist to compress it's

41
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,490
contents and keep only those features
that are needed for localization.

42
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,440
The construction of this map will
be more rigorously explained

43
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,090
in the next course of this specialization.

44
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,330
Where we discuss localization in detail.

45
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,990
The occupancy grid is a 2D or 3D
discretized map of the static objects in

46
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,880
the environments surrounding
the eagle vehicle.

47
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,710
This map is created to identify all
static objects around the autonomous car,

48
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,090
once again,
using point clouds as our input.

49
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,660
The objects which are classified as
static include trees, buildings,

50
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,560
curbs, and
all other nondriveable surfaces.

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,080
For example, in this grid map,
if all occupied grids were colored in,

52
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,059
this is what the occupancy
grid may look like.

53
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:30,182
As the occupancy grid only represents
the static objects from the environment,

54
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:33,310
all dynamic objects must first be removed.

55
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,230
This is done by removing all lidar points
that are found within the bounding boxes

56
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,820
of detected dynamic objects
identified by the perception stack.

57
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,550
Next, static objects
which will not interfere

58
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,770
with the vehicle are also removed.

59
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,000
Such as dryable service or
any over hanging tree branches.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,500
As result of these steps only the relevent
writer points from static objects from

61
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,430
the environment remain.

62
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,360
The filtering process is not perfect and
so

63
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,529
it is not possible to blindly trust
the remaining points are in fact obstacles

64
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,330
The occupancy grid, therefore, represents
the environment probabilistically,

65
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,750
by tracking the likelihood that
a grid cells occupy over time.

66
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:21,120
This map is then relied on to create paths
for the vehicle which are collusion-free.

67
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,110
Both the creation of this map and
its application

68
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,390
to the local planning problem will
be covered in much greater detail.

69
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,090
In course four of the specialization.

70
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,070
Let's look at an example of
an occupancy grid updating over time.

71
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,160
Here, we see the occupancy grid
visualized as the light gray square area,

72
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
under the autonomous car.

73
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,149
Updating the position of static objects
in the environment with black squares.

74
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,110
As the autonomous car moves
through the environment,

75
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,960
all stationary objects in the environment
such as poles, buildings, and

76
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,580
parked cars,
are shown as occupied grid cells.

77
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,570
Finally, the detailed roadmap is
a map of the full road network

78
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,240
which can be driven by
the self-driving car.

79
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,690
This map contains information
regarding the lanes of a road,

80
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,200
as well as any traffic regulation
elements which may affect them.

81
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,730
The detailed road map is
used to plan a safe and

82
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,080
efficient path to be taken
by the self-driving car.

83
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,886
The detailed road map can be
created in one of three ways.

84
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:30,670
Fully online, fully offline,

85
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,570
or created offline and updated online.

86
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,170
A map which is created fully online relies
heavily on the static object proportion

87
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,080
of the perception stack
to accurately label and

88
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,350
correctly localize all relevant
static objects to create the map.

89
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,480
This includes all lane boundaries
in the current driving environment,

90
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,490
any regulation elements,
such as traffic lights or traffic signs,

91
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,900
any regulation attributes of the lanes,
such as right turn markings or crosswalks.

92
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,820
This method of map creation is rarely used

93
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,909
due to the complexity of
creating such a map in real time.

94
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,010
A map which is created entirely offline
is usually done by collecting data

95
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,370
of a given road several times.

96
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,820
Specialized vehicles with high accuracy
sensors are driven along roadways

97
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,880
regularly to construct offline maps.

98
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,680
Once the collection is complete, the
information is then labelled with the use

99
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,980
of a mixture of automatic labelling
from static object perception and

100
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,400
human annotation and correction.

101
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,970
This method of map creation,
while producing very detailed and

102
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,950
accurate maps, is unable to react or
adapt to a changing environment.

103
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,740
The third method of creating detailed
roadmaps is to create them offline and

104
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,840
then update them online with new,
relevant information.

105
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,080
This method of map creation
takes advantage of both methods,

106
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,190
creating a highly accurate roadmap
which can be updated while driving.

107
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:06,070
In course four on motion planning, we
will present a method for storing all of

108
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,000
the information present in a detailed
roadmap called the lane length model.

109
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,940
Let's look at an example
of a detailed roadmap.

110
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,140
As you can see, the lane boundaries of
the detailed roadmap are visualized in red

111
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,910
Along with the boundaries, the center
of each lane is also visualized in red.

112
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,945
This information is vitally important for

113
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:30,380
path-following as it provides
a default path along the lane.

114
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,300
As you can see in this video the vehicle,

115
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,880
while autonomously driving,
neatly follows the center of the lane.

116
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,910
That completes our discussion of
mapping for self-driving cars.

117
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,365
In this video, you learned about three
types of maps commonly used for autonomous

118
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:53,570
driving: The localization map, the
occupancy grid, and the detailed road map.

119
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,620
You'll study each of these map types
further as we dive into localization,

120
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,780
collision avoidance, and

121
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,890
motion planning In the remaining
courses of the specialization.

122
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,120
Congratulations, you
completed the second module

123
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,780
in this introduction to
self-driving cars course.

124
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,720
In this module,
you learned how to select sensing and

125
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,270
computing hardware in self-driving car,

126
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,370
how to design specific sensors [INAUDIBLE]
based on the requirements of driving.

127
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,310
How to decompose the software system for
autonomous driving.

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,990
And what the three main types of maps
are that represent the environment.

129
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,400
In the next module, we will take a closer
look at the vehicle modeling for

130
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,080
the purpose of precision control.

131
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:46,921
I'll see you in the next module.

132
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:51,793
[SOUND]
