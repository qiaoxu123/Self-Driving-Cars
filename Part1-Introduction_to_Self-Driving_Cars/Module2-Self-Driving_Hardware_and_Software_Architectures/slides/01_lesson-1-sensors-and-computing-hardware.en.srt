3
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:21,389
Welcome to the first lesson of week two.

4
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:25,751
This week we will discuss many
details about the hardware and

5
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:30,298
software architecture used in
today's self-driving cars.

6
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:35,322
In particular, we will cover the various
sensors that can be used for perception.

7
00:00:35,322 --> 00:00:38,227
The computing platforms available today.

8
00:00:38,227 --> 00:00:43,417
The basics of designing sensor
configurations for self-driving cars.

9
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:47,121
The components of a typical
autonomy software stack.

10
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:51,031
And finally, we will conclude by
discussing the various ways which we can

11
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:53,629
represent the environment for
self-driving.

12
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,337
Hopefully by the end of this week you
will have a broad understanding of

13
00:00:59,337 --> 00:01:03,328
the equipment and software ideas that
go into making a self-driving car.

14
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:05,606
Let's begin this video.

15
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:08,630
In this video, we will define sensors, and

16
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,881
discuss the various types of sensors
available for the task of perception.

17
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:19,172
And we will then discuss the self-driving
car hardware available nowadays.

18
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:21,620
Let's begin by talking about sensors.

19
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,120
Even the best perception algorithms
are limited by the quality of their

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,026
sensor data.

21
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:30,975
And careful selection of sensors
can go a long way to simplifying

22
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:33,327
the self-driving perception task.

23
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,167
So what is a sensor?

24
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:40,826
A sensor is any device that measures or
detects some property of the environment,

25
00:01:40,826 --> 00:01:43,541
or changes to that property over time.

26
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,934
Sensors are broadly
categorized into two types,

27
00:01:46,934 --> 00:01:49,770
depending on what property they record.

28
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,249
If they record a property of
the environment they are exteroceptive.

29
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:57,930
Extero means outside, or
from the surroundings.

30
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,490
On the other hand, if the sensors
record a property of the ego vehicle,

31
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,242
they are proprioceptive.

32
00:02:04,242 --> 00:02:07,410
Proprios means internal, or one's own.

33
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,636
Let's start by discussing
common exteroceptive sensors.

34
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:17,251
We start with the most common and
widely used sensor in autonomous driving,

35
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:18,054
the camera.

36
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:23,382
Cameras are a passive, light-collecting
sensor that are great at capturing rich,

37
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:25,752
detailed information about a scene.

38
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:30,472
In fact, some groups believe that the
camera is the only sensor truly required

39
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:31,771
for self-driving.

40
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:36,812
But state of the art performance is
not yet possible with vision alone.

41
00:02:36,812 --> 00:02:38,627
While talking about cameras,

42
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:42,611
we usually tend to talk about three
important comparison metrics.

43
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:45,760
We select cameras in terms
of their resolution.

44
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,795
The resolution is the number of
pixels that create the image.

45
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:52,485
So it's a way of specifying
the quality of the image.

46
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:55,516
We can also select cameras on
the basis of field of view.

47
00:02:55,516 --> 00:02:59,698
The field of view is defined by
the horizontal and vertical angular extent

48
00:02:59,698 --> 00:03:04,360
that is visible to the camera, and can be
varied through lens selection and zoom.

49
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,344
Another important metric
is the dynamic range.

50
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:11,357
The dynamic range of the camera is
the difference between the darkest and

51
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,850
the lightest tones in an image.

52
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,223
High dynamic range is critical for
self-driving vehicles due to the highly

53
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:22,881
variable lighting conditions encountered
while driving especially at night.

54
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:26,641
There is an important trade off
cameras and lens selection,

55
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:30,488
that lies between the choice of
field of view and resolution.

56
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:34,590
Wider field of view permit a lager
viewing region in the environment.

57
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,872
But fewer pixels that absorb
light from one particular object.

58
00:03:37,872 --> 00:03:39,710
As the field of view increases,

59
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,408
we need to increase resolution to still be
able to perceive with the same quality,

60
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:47,420
the various kinds of
information we may encounter.

61
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,278
Other properties of cameras that
affect perception exist as well,

62
00:03:52,278 --> 00:03:55,175
such as focal length,
depth of field and frame rate.

63
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:57,701
We'll go into much more
detail on cameras and

64
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:00,830
computer vision in course
three on visual perception.

65
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,053
The combination of two cameras with
overlapping fields of view and

66
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:08,919
aligned image planes is
called the stereo camera.

67
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:14,000
Stereo cameras allow depth estimation
from synchronized image pairs.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,691
Pixel values from image can be
matched to the other image producing

69
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,794
a disparity map of the scene.

70
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:25,070
This disparity can then be used
to estimate depth at each pixel.

71
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,273
Next we have LIDAR which stands for
light detection and ranging sensor.

72
00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:34,270
LIDAR sensing involves shooting
light beams into the environment and

73
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,240
measuring the reflected return.

74
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,981
By measuring the amount of returned
light and time of flight of the beam.

75
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:45,215
Both in intensity in range to
the reflecting object can be estimated.

76
00:04:45,215 --> 00:04:50,769
LIDAR usually include a spinning element
with multiple stacked light sources.

77
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:54,697
And output a three dimensional
point cloud map, which is great for

78
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:57,240
assessing scene geometry.

79
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,759
Because it is an active sensor
with it's own light sources,

80
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,938
LIDAR are not effected by
the environments lighting.

81
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:08,444
So LIDAR do not face the same challenges
as cameras when operating in poor or

82
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,454
variable lighting conditions.

83
00:05:10,454 --> 00:05:14,096
Let's discuss the important comparison
metrics for selecting LIDAR.

84
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:18,856
The first is the number of sources
it contains with 8, 16, 32,

85
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:21,550
and 64 being common sizes.

86
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,232
And the second is the points
per second it can collect.

87
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:30,171
The faster the point collection, the more
detailed the 3D point cloud can be.

88
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:33,470
Another characteristic
is the rotation rate.

89
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,409
The higher this rate, the faster
the 3D point clouds are updated.

90
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:39,726
Detection range is also important,

91
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:44,200
and is dictated by the power
output of the light source.

92
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,826
And finally, we have the field of view,
which once again,

93
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:50,955
is the angular extent
visible to the LIDAR sensor.

94
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:55,498
Finally, we should also mention the new
LIDAR types that are currently emerging.

95
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:58,777
High-resolution, solid-state LIDAR.

96
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:01,951
Without a rotational component
of the typical LIDARs,

97
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:06,220
these sensors stand to become
extremely low-cost and reliable.

98
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,309
Thanks to being implemented
entirely in silicon.

99
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:12,730
HD solid-state LIDAR
are still a work in progress.

100
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:17,047
But definitely something exciting for
the future of affordable self-driving.

101
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:20,990
Our next sensor is RADAR, which stands for
radio detection and ranging.

102
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,797
RADAR sensors have been
around longer than LIDAR and

103
00:06:24,797 --> 00:06:27,495
robustly detect large
objects in the environment.

104
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:31,820
They are particularly useful in adverse
weather as they are mostly unaffected by

105
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,780
precipitation.

106
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,250
Let's discuss some of the comparison
metrics for selecting RADAR.

107
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,681
RADAR are selected based on
detection range, field of view,

108
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:45,360
and the position and
speed measurement accuracy.

109
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,125
RADAR are also typically available as
either having a wide angular field of view

110
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,186
but short range.

111
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:55,380
Or having a narrow filed of view but
a longer range.

112
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,022
The next sensor we are going to
discuss are ultrasonics or sonars.

113
00:07:00,022 --> 00:07:03,710
Originally so named for
sound navigation and ranging.

114
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,024
Which measure range using sound waves.

115
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:10,349
Sonar are sensors that are short
range in inexpensive ranging devices.

116
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,175
This makes them good for
parking scenarios,

117
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,796
where the ego-vehicle needs to make
movements very close to other cars.

118
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:22,790
Another great thing about sonar
is that they are low-cost.

119
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,914
Moreover, just like RADAR and LIDAR,
they are unaffected by lighting and

120
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,562
precipitation conditions.

121
00:07:28,562 --> 00:07:31,139
Sonar is selected based
on a few key metrics.

122
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:38,511
The maximum range they can measure, the
detection field of view, and their cost.

123
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:41,373
Now let's discuss
the proprioceptive sensors,

124
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:44,530
the sensors that sense ego properties.

125
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,286
The most common ones here
are Global Navigation Satellite Systems,

126
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:52,081
GNSS for short, such as GPS or Galileo.

127
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:55,221
An inertial measurement units or IMU's.

128
00:07:55,221 --> 00:08:00,017
GNSS receivers are used to measure
ego vehicle position, velocity,

129
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:01,732
and sometimes heading.

130
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:05,764
The accuracy depends a lot on
the actual positioning methods and

131
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:07,263
the corrections used.

132
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:11,391
Apart from these, the IMU also
measures the angular rotation rate,

133
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:16,158
accelerations of the ego vehicle, and
the combined measurements can be used to

134
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:19,380
estimate the 3D orientation
of the vehicle.

135
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,682
Where heading is the most important for
vehicle control.

136
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:25,670
And finally we have
wheel odometry sensors.

137
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,817
This sensor tracks the wheel
rates of rotation, and

138
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:33,266
uses these to estimate the speed and
heading rate of change of the ego car.

139
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:36,340
This is the same sensor that tracks
the mileage on your vehicle.

140
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,122
So, to summarize,
the major sensors used nowadays for

141
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:47,064
autonomous driving perception
include cameras, RADAR,

142
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:52,130
LIDAR, sonar, GNSS, IMUs,
and wheel odometry modules.

143
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,436
These sensors have many
characteristics that can vary wildly,

144
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:58,960
including resolution,
detection range, and field-of-view.

145
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,997
Selecting an appropriate
sensor configuration for

146
00:09:01,997 --> 00:09:04,141
a self-driving car is not trivial.

147
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:07,263
Here's a simple graphic that
shows each of the sensors and

148
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:08,929
where they usually go on a car.

149
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:13,785
We will revisit this chart again in the
next video, when we discuss how to select

150
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:18,510
sensor configurations to achieve
a particular operational design domain.

151
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,587
Finally, let's discuss a little bit about
the computing hardware most commonly

152
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:26,853
used in today's self-driving cars.

153
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:29,245
The most crucial part
is the computing brain,

154
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:31,400
the main decision making unit of the car.

155
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,825
It takes in all sensor data and outputs
the commands needed to drive the vehicle.

156
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:42,024
Most companies prefer to design their own
computing systems that match the specific

157
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:44,459
requirements of their sensors and
algorithms.

158
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,692
Some hardware options exist, however,

159
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:50,670
that can handle self-driving
computing loads out of the box.

160
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:57,203
The most common examples would be Nvidia's
Drive PX and Intel & Mobileye's EyeQ.

161
00:09:57,203 --> 00:10:02,650
Any computing brain for self-driving needs
both serial and parallel compute modules.

162
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:06,641
Particularly for image and
LIDAR processing to do segmentation,

163
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:08,716
object detection, and mapping.

164
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:12,599
For these we employ GPUs,
FPGAs and custom ASICs,

165
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:17,942
which are specialized hardware to
do a specific type of computation.

166
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:22,840
For example; the drive PX
units include multiple GPUs.

167
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,768
And the EyeQs have FPGAs both to
accelerate parallalizable compute tasks,

168
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:31,391
such as image processing or
neural network inference.

169
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:35,160
And finally,
a quick comment about synchronization.

170
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,003
Because we want to make driving
decisions based on a coherent picture of

171
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:39,923
the road scene.

172
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:44,829
It is essential to correctly synchronize
the different modules in the system, and

173
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:47,120
serve a common clock.

174
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,378
Fortunately, GPS relies on extremely
accurate timing to function, and

175
00:10:51,378 --> 00:10:55,233
as such can act as an appropriate
reference clock when available.

176
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:59,941
Regardless, sensor measurements must be
timestamped with consistent times for

177
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:02,200
sensor fusion to function correctly.

178
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,156
Let's summarize.

179
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:06,713
In this video,
we learned about sensors and

180
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:09,692
their different types based
on what they measure.

181
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:14,260
We covered the major sensors used in
self-driving hardware systems, and

182
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,220
discussed the advantages and
comparison metrics.

183
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,827
And then we briefly discussed
the self-driving computing hardware

184
00:11:21,827 --> 00:11:22,828
available today.

185
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:26,554
Hopefully, this solidifies some of
the concepts we learned last week for

186
00:11:26,554 --> 00:11:28,189
doing autonomous perception.

187
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:32,098
In the next lesson, we'll take a step
further and look at how to select

188
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:35,889
an appropriate sensor configuration for
your self-driving car.

189
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:37,413
See you in the next video.

190
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:47,413
