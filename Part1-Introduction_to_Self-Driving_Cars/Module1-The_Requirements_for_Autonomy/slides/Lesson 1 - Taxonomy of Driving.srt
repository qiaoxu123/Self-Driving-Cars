00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,925
Welcome to the first module of the Introduction to Self-driving Cars course.

2
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:28,020
Throughout this module you will learn about the main components needed to create

3
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,445
a self-driving car and the technical requirements that drive their design.

4
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:35,655
Before we begin, it's important that you understand

5
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:40,585
autonomous vehicle requirements or how we define self-driving for a car.

6
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:44,600
This first week is meant to give you a high level survey of the terms

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,800
and concepts that we'll explore more deeply throughout the specialization.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,660
So in module one,

9
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,425
I will introduce you to the taxonomy for self-driving cars

10
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:58,850
or a system of classification that we use to define driving automation.

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,490
Next, I'll describe the perception needs for

12
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:06,740
the driving task or those items that we need to be able to identify properly.

13
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,335
Finally, we will tackle the question of how to make driving decisions and

14
00:01:12,335 --> 00:01:14,630
discuss a few approaches for making

15
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,350
choices about how a vehicle moves through the environment.

16
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,580
The goal of this first module is to remind you

17
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,925
just how many assessments and decisions the driving task truly requires.

18
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:31,220
Hopefully this will help you appreciate just how much complexity we as humans can

19
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,275
manage effectively when it comes to staying safe on the road. So, let's begin.

20
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:40,595
In this video we will cover the basic self-driving terminology,

21
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:42,710
then discuss some requirements leading to

22
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,175
a classification system for driving automation levels.

23
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:50,680
Define the task of driving and the various components of driving.

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,540
Formulate a taxonomy based on

25
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,515
our requirements and levels of autonomy needed for a driving task.

26
00:01:57,515 --> 00:01:59,870
And finally we will conclude with

27
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,025
the limitations of our proposed taxonomy classification system.

28
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:07,955
Let's get started with some technical terms and definitions.

29
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:11,720
We will use these throughout the specialization and they're helpful to know,

30
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,430
if you're working in this industry.

31
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,000
The first term on our list is the driving task.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,170
Broadly speaking, the driving task is made up of three sub-tasks.

33
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,790
The first sub-task is perception,

34
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,495
or perceiving the environment that we're driving in.

35
00:02:26,495 --> 00:02:29,270
This includes tracking a car's motion in

36
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,135
identifying the various elements in the world around us,

37
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:33,470
like the road surface,

38
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,470
road signs, vehicles, pedestrians and so on.

39
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,670
We also need to track all moving objects and predict their future motions.

40
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,905
So we can drive safely and accurately.

41
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:46,025
The second sub-task is motion planning.

42
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:49,280
This allows us to reach our destination successfully.

43
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,420
For example, you may want to drive from your home to your office.

44
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,220
So you'll need to consider which roads you should take,

45
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,580
when you should change lanes or cross an intersection and

46
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,615
how to execute a swerve maneuver around a pothole along the way.

47
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:07,775
Finally, we need to operate the vehicle itself with vehicle control.

48
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:10,219
So we need to take the appropriate steering,

49
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:12,530
break and acceleration decisions to

50
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,875
control the vehicle's position and velocity on the road.

51
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,990
These three sub-tasks form

52
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:23,135
the main driving task and need to be performed constantly while driving a vehicle.

53
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:25,610
The next concept I'll introduce,

54
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,115
is called the Operational Design Domain or ODD for short.

55
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:33,304
The ODD constitutes the operating conditions

56
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:36,335
under which a given system is designed to function.

57
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:39,605
It includes environmental, time of day,

58
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:44,090
roadway and other characteristics under which the car will perform reliably.

59
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,190
Clearly defining the operating conditions for which a self-driving car is designed,

60
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,935
is crucial to ensuring the safety of the system.

61
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:56,000
So the ODD needs to be planned out carefully in advance.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,070
Now that we know some of the basic terms,

63
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,690
let's get to the big question.

64
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,980
How do we classify the level of automation in a driving system?

65
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,275
Here are some things to consider.

66
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:09,205
First how much driver attention is needed?

67
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:12,605
For example, can you watch a movie while driving to work?

68
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:16,895
Or do you need to keep your attention on the steering wheel at all times?

69
00:04:16,895 --> 00:04:20,240
Driver attention is one of the crucial questions

70
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,785
to consider when defining the level of autonomy.

71
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:27,620
Second, how much driver action is actually needed?

72
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,200
For example do you need to steer?

73
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,520
Does the car take care of the speed or do you control that as well?

74
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,370
Do you need to change lanes or can

75
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,570
the car stay in the current lane without any intervention?

76
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,460
What exactly do we need to expect when we say that the car can automatically drive?

77
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,095
We defined the driving task broadly in the previous slides.

78
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:53,195
But we will need to discuss this in more depth.

79
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:57,425
All of these questions lead us to the autonomous driving taxonomy.

80
00:04:57,425 --> 00:05:02,275
The standards are continuously evolving but for the purposes of our classification,

81
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:07,925
we will use the decomposition suggested by the Society of Automotive Engineers in 2014.

82
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:12,575
You can find a link to this resource in the lesson's supplementary reading.

83
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:18,495
Let's now discuss a way to describe the driving task in increasing levels of automation.

84
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:21,980
First, we have lateral control which refers to

85
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,190
the task of steering and navigating laterally on the road.

86
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:29,890
Turning left, right, going straight or tracking a curve and so on.

87
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,840
Next we have longitudinal control.

88
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,060
This is the task where we control the position or velocity of the car along the roadway,

89
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,590
through actions like breaking or acceleration.

90
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:48,270
Then we have Object and Event Detection and Response or OEDR for short.

91
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,820
OEDR is essentially the ability to detect objects and events

92
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,455
that immediately affect the driving task and to react to them appropriately.

93
00:05:57,455 --> 00:06:02,365
OEDR really encompasses a large portion of autonomous driving.

94
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:04,350
So, is used in conjunction with

95
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:10,145
the specific Operational Design Domain to categorize current self-driving systems.

96
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:12,215
Next we have planning.

97
00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:14,780
Planning is another important aspect of driving.

98
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,290
As immediate response is already part of OEDR,

99
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:23,390
planning is primarily concerned with the long and short term plans needed to travel to

100
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:29,145
a destination or execute maneuvers such as lean changes and intersection crossings.

101
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:33,500
Finally, there are some miscellaneous tasks that people do while driving as well.

102
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,725
These include actions like signaling with indicators,

103
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:40,880
hand-waving, interacting with other drivers and so on.

104
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,610
Now we have a clear description of what tasks we expect a self-driving car to perform.

105
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,269
Let's now discuss the questions that can lead us to the taxonomy

106
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:54,220
for classifying the level of automation in a self-driving car.

107
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,785
First, can this system handle steering tasks or lateral control?

108
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,610
Second, can it perform acceleration,

109
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,025
braking and velocity manipulation tasks or longitudinal control?

110
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:12,815
Third, can the system perform object and event detection and response and to what degree?

111
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:17,090
Crucially, can the system handle emergency situations by

112
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:22,235
itself or does it always need a driver to be attentive during emergencies?

113
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:27,320
Finally, can the system perform in all scenarios and all conditions?

114
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:33,020
Or does it have a limited ODD or set of operating conditions that it can handle safely?

115
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,445
Based on these questions let's walk through the commonly-used levels of

116
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:42,840
automation defined by the SAE Standard J3 016.

117
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,620
Let's start with full human perception,

118
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,845
planning and control and call this level 0.

119
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:51,980
In this level, there is no driving automation

120
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,730
whatsoever and everything is done by the driver.

121
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,390
If an autonomous system assist the driver by

122
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,410
performing either lateral or longitudinal control tasks,

123
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,810
we are in level one autonomy.

124
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,995
Adaptive cruise control is a good example of level one.

125
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:13,010
In adaptive cruise control or ACC,

126
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,320
the system can control the speed of the car.

127
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,125
But it needs the driver to perform steering.

128
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:23,260
So it can perform longitudinal control but needs the human to perform lateral control.

129
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,560
Similarly, lane keeping assist systems are also Level one.

130
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,420
In lane keeping assistance,

131
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,820
the system can help you stay within

132
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,615
your lane and warn you when you are drifting towards the boundaries.

133
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,600
Today's systems rely on visual detection of

134
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,335
lane boundaries coupled with lane centering lateral control.

135
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,420
Let's move on to the next level,

136
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,445
the level of partial automation.

137
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:49,910
In level two the system performs both the control tasks,

138
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,470
lateral and longitudinal in specific driving scenarios.

139
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,710
Some simple examples of level two features are

140
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,295
GM Super Cruise and Nissan's Pro Pilot Assist.

141
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:04,775
These can control both your lateral and longitudinal motion

142
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:08,510
but the driver monitoring of the system is always required.

143
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:12,110
Nowadays, many automotive manufacturers offer

144
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,760
level two automation products including Mercedes,

145
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,735
Audi, Tesla and Hyundai.

146
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:21,015
Next up is level three.

147
00:09:21,015 --> 00:09:24,469
In level three or the level of conditional automation,

148
00:09:24,469 --> 00:09:25,865
the system can perform

149
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,190
Object and Event Detection in Response to

150
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,410
a certain degree in addition to the control tasks.

151
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,760
However, in the case of failure the control must be taken up by the driver.

152
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,845
The key difference between level two and three,

153
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:45,395
is that the driver does not need to pay attention in certain specific situations,

154
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:48,995
as the vehicle can alert the driver in time to intervene.

155
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:52,700
This is a controversial level of automation as it is not always

156
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,215
possible for an autonomy system to know when it is experiencing a failure.

157
00:09:57,215 --> 00:09:59,660
An example of level three systems,

158
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,050
would be the Audi A Luxury Sedan,

159
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,975
which was an automated driving system that can navigate unmonitored in slow traffic.

160
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:12,140
In the next level, we arrive at highly automated vehicles,

161
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,170
where the system is capable of reaching a minimum risk condition,

162
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,005
in case the driver doesn't intervene in time for an emergency.

163
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:24,290
Level four systems can handle emergencies on their own but may still ask

164
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,680
drivers to take over to avoid pulling over to the side of the road unnecessarily.

165
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,780
With this amount of automation,

166
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,750
the passengers can check their phone or watch a movie knowing that

167
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,360
the system is able to handle emergencies and is capable of keeping the passengers safe.

168
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,985
However, level four still permits self-driving systems with a limited ODD.

169
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:48,235
As of fall 2018,

170
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:52,645
only Waymo has deployed vehicles for public transport with this level of autonomy.

171
00:10:52,645 --> 00:10:55,300
The Waymo fleet can handle the driving task in

172
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,320
a defined geographic area with a nominal set of operating conditions,

173
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,495
without the need for a human driver.

174
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:07,675
Finally, in level five the system is fully autonomous and its ODD is unlimited.

175
00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:11,125
Meaning that it can operate under any condition necessary.

176
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:15,415
Level five is the point where our society undergoes transformational change.

177
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:19,930
With driverless taxis shuttling people in packages wherever we need them.

178
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,880
We don't have any examples for level five yet,

179
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,810
but maybe you'll be the one to bring these to reality someday soon.

180
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:32,345
I think to note the levels of autonomy or actually a coarse measure of automation.

181
00:11:32,345 --> 00:11:35,780
In fact, it is possible for two car models to claim level

182
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,205
four autonomy but have very different capabilities in ODDs.

183
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:42,080
So, let's summarize.

184
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,130
In this video we covered various concepts relating to automation.

185
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,620
We covered some basic definitions including

186
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,820
the Operational Design Domain and the concept of the driving task.

187
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,245
And we explored the five levels of driving automation.

188
00:11:57,245 --> 00:12:01,340
You can now assess the level of automation in a self-driving system.

189
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,325
In the next lesson we will explore the requirements

190
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:09,130
for perception,a crucial aspect for Autonomous System Design.
