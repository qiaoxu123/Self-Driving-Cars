00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,200
Welcome to the third and final video of this week.

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,405
In this video, we will be discussing decision-making in the self-driving car system.

3
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:25,310
Recall that in the last video,

4
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,365
we discussed the perception which forms the first step in performing a driving task.

5
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:33,620
The other steps in driving include decision-making and then,

6
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,310
finally, executing the decisions.

7
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:41,750
In this video, we will categorize planning informally on the basis of the window

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,350
of time over which the decision has to be made and discuss some examples.

9
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,340
Then we will go over a simple intersection scenario and try to list out

10
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,190
some of the various decisions needed to complete the driving task successfully.

11
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,050
We will then categorize planning formerly

12
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,290
based on the type of logic we use to make the decisions.

13
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,800
So, is our logic made up of well-defined rules that

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,095
react only to currently available information about the driving environment?

15
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:16,430
Or is it also dependent on trajectory predictions of other agents?

16
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,605
Let's get started.

17
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:23,120
Making driving decisions falls under the bigger umbrella of planning.

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,010
When we make driving decisions,

19
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,340
we usually have three kinds of decisions to make.

20
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,475
The first type is a long-term planning decision.

21
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:32,960
A question such as,

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,465
how do I navigate from New York to Los Angeles or from my home to work?

23
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:38,955
By answering this question,

24
00:01:38,955 --> 00:01:40,420
we have a mission plan,

25
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,195
a high-level plan for the entire driving task.

26
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:47,720
Mapping applications that you use today are able to give you

27
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,060
these driving instructions: which roads to take,

28
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,390
which lanes to be in, and so on.

29
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,000
But driving needs much more than that.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,470
The second type is a short-term driving decision with questions like,

31
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,540
is it safe to change lanes now?

32
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,425
Or when should I execute a left turn at an intersection?

33
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:11,110
Driving also needs some immediate decisions or reactions.

34
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,630
These decisions involve control and trajectory planning and answer questions like,

35
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,420
how do I follow my lane on this curved road?

36
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,505
What steering input should I apply?

37
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:23,245
Should I accelerate or brake?

38
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:25,505
If so, by how much.

39
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:29,390
Let's discuss a very simple example of a driving task

40
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,845
and try to think about what kind of decisions are involved.

41
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:35,620
Note that throughout this specialization,

42
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,630
we will assume right-handed driving for all scenarios.

43
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,360
Suppose you are approaching an intersection on your way home.

44
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,740
The long-term planning stage requires you to turn left at this intersection.

45
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:53,210
Now, let's look at the intermediate and short-term decisions that need to be made.

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,180
First, let's assume that the intersection is controlled.

47
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,715
That is, it has traffic lights.

48
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:02,270
Since you are turning left,

49
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:07,700
you have to identify if you need to make a lane change into a left turning lane.

50
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,670
Then, as you're approaching this intersection,

51
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,175
you choose to slow down,

52
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:16,525
and to do so smoothly so that the passengers don't experience discomfort.

53
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:19,390
Nobody likes a jerky driver after all.

54
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,155
You then come to a stop just before the stop line,

55
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:25,270
before a pedestrian crossing.

56
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,930
These decisions on lane changes and stopping locations are

57
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,300
all short-term planning decisions. But wait!

58
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,940
You also need to think and respond to situations that arise along the way.

59
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,280
We still need object and event detection and response.

60
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,900
What if a vehicle pulls into the turn lane in front of you?

61
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,785
You would want to stop earlier to make room for the other vehicle.

62
00:03:48,785 --> 00:03:51,340
What if the stop lines weren't marked?

63
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,810
You would have to approximately judge where

64
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,220
the implied stop line is and stop before the pedestrian crossing.

65
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,070
What if there were other vehicles behind you or even stalled in the intersection?

66
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,250
How does the decision to execute a left turn change

67
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,780
based on the many possible scenarios that can rapidly arise in normal driving?

68
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,910
All of these decisions fall into

69
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:19,370
the immediate decision category and requires safe reactions from the planning system.

70
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,070
The end result is an exploding list of

71
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,280
possible decisions to evaluate on different timescales,

72
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,980
even for a simple left turn scenario.

73
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,980
This amounts to talking about different cases for

74
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,615
the same intersection crossing or scenarios.

75
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:38,960
In each scenario, we need a consistent set of choices to be evaluated in

76
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,370
real time and updated as new information about the scene becomes available.

77
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,520
Furthermore, because decisions to change lanes affect

78
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,960
where to drive and which cars to regulate our position relative to,

79
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,865
even a seemingly simple driving scenario requires three or four levels of decisions,

80
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:02,660
and must then still be executed with careful vehicle control.

81
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,110
This example is really only scratching the surface of

82
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,025
the constant stream of decisions needed for motion planning.

83
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:13,760
The bottom line is, driving is complicated.

84
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,895
Let's go ahead and discuss a possible structure to represent these decisions in software.

85
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:25,880
One method to address the challenge of multilevel decision-making is reactive planning.

86
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,460
In reactive planning, we define sets of rules that take into account the current state of

87
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,255
the ego vehicle and other objects in the environment and produce immediate actions.

88
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:43,445
So, these are rules that only consider the current state and not future predictions.

89
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:46,700
Some examples of such rules would be,

90
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,420
if there is a pedestrian on the road, stop.

91
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,005
Or if the speed limit changes,

92
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:54,285
adjust your speed to match it.

93
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:56,260
In both of these rules,

94
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,240
we just observe what is happening right now and make

95
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,540
our decision based on immediately available information.

96
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,255
But there are other kinds of planning as well.

97
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:09,575
In predictive planning, we make predictions on how other agents in the environment,

98
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:11,210
like vehicles and pedestrians,

99
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,860
will move over time.

100
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:19,235
We use this current state and prediction information to define all of our decisions.

101
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:23,645
Some examples of rules in predictive planning would be,

102
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:26,690
that car has stopped for the last 10 seconds.

103
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,890
It's probably going to stay stopped for the next few seconds.

104
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,650
So, perhaps there is a way that I can move past it safely.

105
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,440
Or a pedestrian is jaywalking.

106
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,170
They will enter our lane by the time I get close to them.

107
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,885
Let me slow down and give them a chance to cross the road ahead of me.

108
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:47,480
As you can see, this is a more natural way to think,

109
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,945
and relates closely to how humans operate vehicles.

110
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:53,780
We predict where other objects on the road will

111
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,765
be in the future before we make our decisions.

112
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:58,720
This type of planning, however,

113
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,400
relies on accurate predictions of the actions of the other actors in the environment,

114
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,460
which adds a significant layer of complexity to the perception tasks.

115
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,240
Nonetheless, predictive planning is the predominant method for self-driving cars,

116
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,935
as it greatly expands the scenarios a vehicle can handle safely.

117
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:22,680
We will discuss all aspects of planning in

118
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,410
a further detail in course four on planning for self-driving cars,

119
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,545
where we will show you the methods to solve long-term,

120
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:34,015
short-term, and immediate-term planning problems.

121
00:07:34,015 --> 00:07:36,990
All right. Let's summarize this video.

122
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,960
We discussed the planning problem and the different types of planning

123
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,445
based on the window of time over which we have to act.

124
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:48,135
These types are long-term,

125
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,895
short-term, and immediate planning.

126
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:54,380
Then we discussed a simple intersection scenario,

127
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,240
where we had to make a left turn.

128
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,870
We concluded that driving is a really hard problem

129
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,350
since we have so many variables and possibilities that result.

130
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,385
Then we discussed two different planning approaches:

131
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:10,480
reactive planning and predictive planning.

132
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,025
This is just the tip of the iceberg.

133
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,410
There's clearly so much more we need to think about

134
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,695
before making a decision during the driving task.

135
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:23,960
Once again, we will go through all of these ideas in much greater detail in course four.

136
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,960
That brings us to the end of the first week of

137
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,960
course one in our self-driving car specialization.

138
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,065
Let's quickly recap what we learned this week.

139
00:08:33,065 --> 00:08:35,329
In this module, we explored

140
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:38,195
the basic autonomous driving terminology

141
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:41,300
that's useful for later weeks of the specialization.

142
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,819
We then discussed the levels of automation,

143
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:48,005
and came up with a taxonomy to characterize self-driving capabilities.

144
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:51,475
Then we define the driving task and the major components of

145
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:55,295
driving: perception, planning, and execution.

146
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,250
We then listed the elements and agents in

147
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,340
the environment we need to identify and track for perception.

148
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,440
We also discussed why perception is so hard.

149
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,369
Then we discussed planning with its different horizons,

150
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:09,920
and looked at some decision-making approaches.

151
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,419
In the next module,

152
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:14,660
we will define the main components of self-driving cars,

153
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,825
including both the hardware and software elements

154
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:21,840
that make up a complete system. See you then.
