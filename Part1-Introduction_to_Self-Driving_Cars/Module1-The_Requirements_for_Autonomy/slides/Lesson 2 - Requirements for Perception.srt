00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,315
Welcome to the second lesson in this module.

2
00:00:17,315 --> 00:00:18,730
In the previous lesson,

3
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,125
we learned how to classify automation

4
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,755
according to its capabilities and operational design domain.

5
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:29,975
In this lesson, we will start analyzing how a driving task is performed.

6
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:34,565
More specifically, we will go over the many processes of perception.

7
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:37,910
We will first define the perception task,

8
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,790
listing out the requirements for perceptions such as

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,405
what static and dynamic objects we need to identify,

10
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:50,305
and what needs we have for tracking the ego vehicles motion through the environment.

11
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:53,270
Finally, we will conclude with a discussion on

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,500
some challenges to robust perception. So let's dive in.

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,810
Very roughly speaking, any driving tasks can be broken down into two components.

14
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,730
First, we need to understand what's happening around us and where we are.

15
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,745
So, we need to perceive our surroundings.

16
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:12,685
Secondly, we need to make a driving decision.

17
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:19,120
For example, should we accelerate or stop before a pedestrian about to enter the roadway?

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,240
Recall from the previous lesson the concept of

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,185
OEDR or object and event detection and response.

20
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:29,860
Any driving task requires some kind of OEDR, that is,

21
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,370
we need some way of identifying objects around us,

22
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,765
recognizing events happening near us,

23
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:37,705
and then responding to it.

24
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:41,330
Recall that the classification of automated systems that we

25
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,735
discussed had OEDR as one of the criteria.

26
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:47,630
In other words, if we want to build a self-driving car,

27
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,510
we need to be able to perform OEDR.

28
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,595
Let's go further and analyze a crucial part of OEDR perception.

29
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:57,590
So, what is perception?

30
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,620
As we discussed, we want to be able to make sense of

31
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,225
the environment around us and the way we're moving within it.

32
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:08,059
In particular, for any agent or element on the road,

33
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:10,790
we need to first identify what it is;

34
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,150
a car, a cyclist, a bus, etc.

35
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,685
And second, we want to understand its motion;

36
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:22,500
has it been moving in a certain way that can tell us what it will do next.

37
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,820
As humans, we're really good at understanding patterns.

38
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,459
However, it's still difficult for computer systems to be able to recognize

39
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:35,405
these same patterns around us as quickly as we do.

40
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,955
We can point to a car going straight and say,

41
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:41,855
"Oh, it will be in this position in some amount of time in the future."

42
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:44,390
This is what makes driving possible for us.

43
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,670
So, this ability of predicting

44
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,930
the trajectory of a moving object is really important to perception.

45
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,450
If we can do this prediction correctly,

46
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,340
we can make informed decisions.

47
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,135
For example, if I know what the car in front of me is going to do next,

48
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:04,550
then I can decide what to do next in such a way that both of our goals are met.

49
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,760
Let's discuss the various elements we need to

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,945
be able to identify for the perception task.

51
00:03:10,945 --> 00:03:14,345
First, we need to identify static elements.

52
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:17,809
These are elements like roads and lane markings,

53
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:21,980
things that segregate regions on the roads like zebra crossings,

54
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,325
and important messages such as school up ahead.

55
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:28,625
These are all on the road area.

56
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,640
Then there are off-road elements like curbs that

57
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,795
define the boundaries within which we can drive.

58
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:38,090
There are the on-road traffic signals that periodically

59
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,180
change and signal whether you are allowed to move forward,

60
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,320
or left, or right,

61
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,990
or just stay stopped.

62
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,220
Then there are all kinds of road signs like those telling you the speed limit,

63
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,340
indicating direction, whether there is a hospital coming up,

64
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,395
or a school coming up, and so on.

65
00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:55,970
Again, these are off-road elements.

66
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,305
Finally, there are road obstructions.

67
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,580
So, the orange cones that tell you construction is

68
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,490
happening or that there is roadblock edge and so on.

69
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,560
Also, these are on road elements.

70
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,205
Second, let's discuss the dynamic elements that we need to identify for perception.

71
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:14,860
These are the elements whose motion we need to

72
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,950
predict to make informed driving decisions.

73
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,460
We need to identify other vehicles on the road,

74
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,340
so four wheelers like trucks, buses, cars,

75
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,255
and so on, and then we also need to identify and predict the motion of two wheelers,

76
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:34,480
like motorcycles, bicycles, and so forth.

77
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,860
These are all moving systems with more freedom than four wheelers,

78
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,335
and so they are harder to predict.

79
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:44,500
Finally, we should also be able to identify and

80
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,160
predict the motion of pedestrians around us.

81
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,600
How pedestrians behave is very different from

82
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,330
vehicles as pedestrians are known to be much more

83
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,150
erratic than vehicles in their motion because of

84
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,090
the inherent freedom that humans have in the way they move.

85
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,180
Another crucial goal for perception is ego localization.

86
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,620
We need to be able to estimate where we are and how we are moving at any point in time.

87
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,115
Knowing our position and how we are moving in the environment

88
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:17,000
is crucial to making informed and safe driving decisions.

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,725
The data used for ego motion estimation comes from GPS, IMU,

90
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:24,200
and odometry sensors, and needs to be

91
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,250
combined together to generate a coherent picture of our position.

92
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,700
The second and third courses of this specialization

93
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,985
will dive deeply into these essential perception tasks,

94
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:38,240
starting with ego localization in course two,

95
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,970
and followed by on and off road object detection and tracking in course three.

96
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,235
Now that we've discussed the main goals for perception,

97
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:51,995
let's conclude this discussion by going over why perception is also a difficult problem.

98
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:56,665
First, performing robust perception is a huge challenge.

99
00:05:56,665 --> 00:06:01,639
Detection and segmentation can be approached with modern machine learning methods,

100
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,400
but there is much ongoing research to improve

101
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,960
the reliability and performance to achieve human level capability.

102
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,785
Access to large datasets is critical to this effort.

103
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:14,500
With more training data,

104
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,285
our segmentation and detection models perform better and more robustly,

105
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:22,850
but collecting and labeling data for all possible vehicle types,

106
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,790
weather conditions, and road surfaces is a very expensive and time-consuming process.

107
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,200
Second, perception is not immune to censor uncertainty.

108
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,319
There are many times that visibility can be challenging,

109
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,585
or GPS measurements get corrupted,

110
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:43,385
or LIDAR and Radar returns are noisy in terms of their position value.

111
00:06:43,385 --> 00:06:45,740
Every subsystem that relies on

112
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,580
these sensors must take uncertain measurements into account.

113
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,230
This is why it is absolutely crucial to design subsystems that can

114
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,945
accommodate sensor uncertainty and corrupted measurements in every perception task.

115
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:05,410
Then there are effects such as occlusion and reflection in camera or LIDAR data.

116
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,350
These can confuse perception methods with ambiguous information that

117
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,760
is challenging to resolve into accurate estimates of object locations.

118
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,955
There are also effects such as drastic illumination changes and lens flare,

119
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:21,920
or GPS outages and tunnels which makes

120
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,310
some sensor data completely unusable or unavailable.

121
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,730
Perception methods need multiple redundant sources of

122
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,620
information to overcome sensor data loss.

123
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,230
Finally, there's weather and precipitation that can

124
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,260
adversely affect the quality of input data from sensors.

125
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,970
So, it is crucial to have

126
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,540
at least some sensors that are immune to different weather conditions,

127
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,235
for example radar.

128
00:07:46,235 --> 00:07:48,250
Let's summarize.

129
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,625
In this video, we briefly went through the main tasks for perception.

130
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:56,390
The task of detecting and assessing various types of

131
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,670
static and dynamic objects and agents in the environment,

132
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:06,305
and the task of making sense of how the ego vehicle is moving through the environment.

133
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:11,435
Finally, we concluded with a discussion of why perception is a hard problem.

134
00:08:11,435 --> 00:08:13,130
That's it for this video.

135
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,170
See you in the next video where we will be

136
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,230
discussing the decision-making aspects of autonomous driving.
