00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,175
Welcome to the final video of this week.

2
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:21,030
In this video, we will discuss some popular safety frameworks,

3
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,805
some of which we encountered in the last lesson.

4
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:27,585
More specifically, we will describe some generic,

5
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:30,945
analytical frameworks including fault trees,

6
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:34,125
failure modes and effects analyses or FMEA,

7
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,560
and hazard and operability analysis or HAZOP.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,095
Then we will focus on

9
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:45,060
automotive and autonomous safety frameworks and discuss functional safety or FUSA,

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,565
and safety of intended functionality, or SOTIF.

11
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:51,545
We'll define these terms later on in the video.

12
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:56,495
Let's begin. We'll start off with fault tree analysis.

13
00:00:56,495 --> 00:01:00,410
Fault trees can be used as a preliminary analysis framework,

14
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,940
and can be steadily expanded to encompass as much details necessary.

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,420
Fault trees are top-down flows in which we

16
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,870
analyze a possible failure of a system to be avoided,

17
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,540
and then identify all of the ways in which it can

18
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,045
occur from events and failures at lower levels of the system.

19
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:23,345
The top node in a fault tree is the root or top event.

20
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:26,825
The intermediate nodes in the fault tree are logic gates,

21
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:29,885
that define possible causes for the root event.

22
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:33,365
The decomposition continues to a level of detail

23
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:36,980
for which a probability of such an event can be defined.

24
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,220
The fault tree can then be analyzed by combining

25
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,595
the probabilities using the laws of Boolean logic.

26
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:46,205
To assess the overall probability of

27
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:51,590
root cause event and the causes that most contribute to its occurrence.

28
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,155
Let's consider a simple example,

29
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,320
and take a car crash as our root event.

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,840
The cause of a car crash could be broken down

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,535
into either a software failure or a hardware failure,

32
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:06,680
amongst many other possibilities that we've

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,740
described as hazard classes in our earlier videos.

34
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,560
Very crudely, the hardware failure could be because of

35
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,600
manufacturing defects or material imperfections, for example.

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,910
Similarly, a software error could be due to

37
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,900
malfunctioning perception code or some cybersecurity problem,

38
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,520
say, if we were hacked.

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,510
From there, we can proceed to software subsystems and

40
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,555
specific calculations within those subsystems

41
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:39,065
deepening the tree at each successive branching.

42
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:43,460
Ultimately, we'll arrive at specific failure rates for which we can

43
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,410
assign probabilities of occurrence per hour or per mile of operation.

44
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,490
We have now arrived at the leaf nodes of the fault tree.

45
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,580
Then using the logic gates structure,

46
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,415
we can explicitly compute statistics of

47
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:03,965
overall failure rates given assessments of the individual leaf node failure rates.

48
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:08,720
The operations used to propagate these probabilities upwards would

49
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,400
be the same as the rules of probability when events follow set theory.

50
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,015
So, for example, for independent events,

51
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:23,525
the OR and AND probabilities would be the sum or product of children node probabilities.

52
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:26,615
This is the general idea behind fault trees,

53
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:29,390
which are referred to as probabilistic fault trees,

54
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,825
when probabilities are included at the leaf nodes.

55
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:37,519
Probabilistic fault trees are a top-down approach to safety

56
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,840
that has been widely used in the nuclear and aerospace industries,

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,960
and can similarly be applied to autonomous driving.

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,130
The challenge lies in building a comprehensive tree and

59
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,725
incorrectly identifying the probabilities of the leaf node events.

60
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:56,260
Let's now look at FMEA,

61
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,660
which stands for failure modes and effects analyses.

62
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,065
Whereas fault trees flow down from a system failure to all of its possible causes,

63
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:08,285
FMEA is a bottom-up process that looks at

64
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:12,980
individual causes and determines all the possible effects that might occur.

65
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:20,110
Often, FTA's and FMEA's are used together to assess safety critical systems.

66
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,405
Failure modes are modes or ways in which

67
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:29,005
a particular component of the overall system can cause the system to fail.

68
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:32,870
Effects analysis refers to analyzing all

69
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,305
of the possible effects these mode failures can cause.

70
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:39,470
Often, the effects analysis seeks to identify

71
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,739
those modes that bring about the most critical failures,

72
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:45,980
which can then lead to improved designs that add

73
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,835
more redundancy or higher reliability to the system.

74
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:54,035
Let's come to the big idea behind FMEA.

75
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:58,415
The goal is to categorize failure modes by priority.

76
00:04:58,415 --> 00:05:01,040
So, we ask questions like,

77
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,445
how serious are the effects,

78
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:08,065
how frequently do these failures happen,

79
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:12,185
and how easy is it to detect these failures?

80
00:05:12,185 --> 00:05:16,444
Then we quantify all the failures using priority values,

81
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:21,100
then we start addressing the failures with the highest priority first.

82
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:27,485
Here are the steps. The goal is to construct a table of all possible risky situations,

83
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:29,510
and we start off by,

84
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,440
first discussing with field experts and

85
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,580
identifying processes at the level of detail we want in the table.

86
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:42,125
Then, we question the purpose of the system and list all failure possibilities.

87
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,065
Then for each failure possibility,

88
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:48,290
we identify the possible consequences and assign

89
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,975
each consequence a severity rating between one and 10,

90
00:05:51,975 --> 00:05:54,045
10 being the most severe.

91
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:58,670
For each consequence, we identify the possible root causes,

92
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,930
and for each route cause,

93
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,465
we assign another number between one and 10,

94
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:05,860
to denote how frequently this cause occurs.

95
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,705
Then, we identify all the ways in which the failure mode can be detected by operator,

96
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,885
maintenance, inspection, or a fault detection system.

97
00:06:14,885 --> 00:06:18,620
We assess the overall mode detection likelihood before

98
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,650
it causes an effect and assign another score from 1-10,

99
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:28,890
with one being guaranteed to be detected and 10 being impossible to detect.

100
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:34,180
Finally, we compute a final number called the risk priority number,

101
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,495
which is the product of the severity,

102
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,955
the occurrence, and the detection.

103
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:40,740
The higher this value is,

104
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,810
the higher the priority is.

105
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,360
Eventually, we address the most problematic failure modes by modifying

106
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,505
our implementation of the system until we reduce the risks to an acceptable level.

107
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:55,685
It is also possible to perform FMEA with

108
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:59,480
actual failure probabilities as in fault tree analysis,

109
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,450
and to define acceptable risk levels in terms of

110
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,955
the likelihood of a critical event occurring over a fixed period of operation.

111
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:10,880
The method doesn't change just the meaning of

112
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,685
the numbers and the complexity of completing the entire analysis.

113
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:19,190
Let's stick with the simple scoring approach and make

114
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,940
the FMEA process more concrete with a brief example.

115
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,740
Consider, a specific failure where the vehicle has driven

116
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,510
onto a gravel patch that appears in its test area due to road construction,

117
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,495
which leads to controller instability.

118
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:39,535
The worst-case effect could be a physical crash,

119
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:41,790
which would be severity 10.

120
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,610
It might also lead to driver discomfort,

121
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,075
or a near miss,

122
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:48,935
but these would be lower severity events.

123
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:52,280
This event could happen regularly in urban environments

124
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,175
wherever construction of a particular type occurs.

125
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,885
So, it is somewhat likely.

126
00:07:56,885 --> 00:08:00,820
Let's say we're able to assess the occurrence number at four.

127
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,510
Similarly, we can assign a current scores to the other effects.

128
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,710
Let's assume this problem is not currently detectable as

129
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,080
the road surface texture is not actively

130
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,625
monitored during operation of our autonomy software.

131
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:20,650
So, detectability would be at number 10 for all of these effects.

132
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,990
The risk priority number for a crash would then be 10 times 4 times 10, which is 400.

133
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,705
In the same way, we could have other failure modes as well.

134
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:38,280
A sign perception failure with the priority number of a 100, let's say,

135
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:43,940
a GPS synchronization failure with a priority number of 300,

136
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,660
and maybe a vehicle motion prediction failure with the priority of 150.

137
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,150
So, we would go about addressing these failures in

138
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:58,190
implementation by focusing on driving on gravel than GPS failure,

139
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,070
than motion prediction, and finally sign perception.

140
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,850
And so this is the general framework behind FMEA.

141
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,470
FMEA is a risk assessment idea that was developed by

142
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,115
the military and aerospace industries and later brought to the automotive industry.

143
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:19,525
It provides a really structured way to quantify risks and deal with them.

144
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,640
The most important first.

145
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,345
Lastly, a common variation on FMEA that appears frequently,

146
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:30,235
is the Hazard and Operability Study or HAZOP.

147
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:35,085
HAZOP is more of a qualitative process as compared to FMEA,

148
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:38,840
where we seek to define the risks quantitatively.

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,020
So, in HAZOP, the main purpose is to

150
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:48,370
brainstorm effectively over the set of possible hazards that can arise.

151
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,600
For complex processes, the risks can be assessed

152
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,960
without having to assign specific values to occurrence,

153
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,345
severity and detection, which may be hard to do.

154
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:05,270
HAZOP is often used earlier in the design process to guide the conceptual design phase.

155
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,040
The key addition in HAZOP is that,

156
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,380
guide words are used to lead the brainstorm applied to each system requirement.

157
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,685
These guide words include things like not, more, less,

158
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:23,780
early, late and lead to possible failure modes that might not otherwise be considered.

159
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:30,545
So think of HAZOP as a simplified ongoing FMEA brainstorming approach.

160
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:35,460
Let's now focus on a more specific type of safety and discuss

161
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,250
existing safety frameworks for automotive and low-level autonomy feature development,

162
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:45,360
which are often used in assessing hardware and software failures in autonomous vehicles.

163
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,030
In particular, let's discuss the functional safety approach

164
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:53,440
described in ISO 26262 and the safety of

165
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,580
intended functionality approach which extends on ISO to

166
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:02,900
26262 and is defined in ISOPAR 21448.1.

167
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,060
We won't be able to go into significant detail on either process,

168
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,570
but I've included links to supplemental materials, if you'd like to learn more.

169
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,200
Functional Safety or FUSA,

170
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,500
is the absence of unreasonable risk from

171
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:23,190
malfunctioning behavior caused by failures of the hardware and software in a car,

172
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,535
or unintended behaviors arising with respect to its intended design.

173
00:11:28,535 --> 00:11:33,350
The ISO 262 standard defines functional safety terms and

174
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:38,350
activities for electrical and electronic systems within motor vehicles.

175
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,990
As such, addresses only the hardware and software hazards

176
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,770
that can affect autonomous vehicle safety.

177
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:51,195
The standard defines four Automotive Safety Integrity Levels or ASIL.

178
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:55,720
With ASIL D being the most stringent and A being the least.

179
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,325
Each level has associated with it specific development requirements,

180
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:03,195
that must be adhered to for certification.

181
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:07,435
The functional safety process follows a V-shaped flow.

182
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:12,139
Starting at the top left with requirements specification then analysis

183
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:17,105
of hazards and risks and proceeding to implementation of functionality.

184
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:22,590
We then climb up the right branch to confirm the design goals have been met.

185
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,825
We start with low-level verifications such as software unit tests,

186
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:32,080
and then proceed to subsystem and full system validation through simulation,

187
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,335
test track, operations and on-road testing.

188
00:12:35,335 --> 00:12:37,685
As we descend the V on the left,

189
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:41,630
high-level requirements turn into low-level implementations.

190
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,945
And as we climb the V on the right,

191
00:12:43,945 --> 00:12:47,510
we confirm each low-level function implementation before

192
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,675
combining them to confirm system requirements for safe operation.

193
00:12:51,675 --> 00:12:55,860
The final step is a summary functional safety assessment,

194
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,410
to evaluate residual risk and

195
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,665
determine if our system has reached an acceptable level of safety.

196
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:05,760
At the start of the functional safety V,

197
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,070
we use HARA or Hazard and Risk Assessment.

198
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,160
In HARA, we identify and categorize

199
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,450
hazardous events and specify requirements to avoid unreasonable risk.

200
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,170
This process drives all of the system development and testing beyond this point.

201
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,660
To do so, we first identify possible hardware and software

202
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,595
faults or malfunctions and unintended functions that can affect car safety.

203
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:36,340
This is where FMEA or HAZOP are used in

204
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,740
the functional safety framework and leads to a specific set of hazards to our system.

205
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,920
We then define a list of scenarios or situations that

206
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,565
the system must operate in drawing on our ODD to create this list.

207
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:57,880
Next, we combine hazards and situations into hazardous events, describe expected damages,

208
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,490
and determine risk parameters,

209
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,490
to calculate numerical values of

210
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:06,310
potential risk for each combination of situation and hazard.

211
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,270
After the risk assessment,

212
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,500
we choose the highest risk scenarios.

213
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:16,110
The worst-case events that can happen with respect to each possible malfunction.

214
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:23,170
Then finally, we define our safety requirements based on these worst-case scenarios.

215
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,580
The HARA process sets the design goals for the system in

216
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,170
a way that is aware of all of the worst-case failures that can occur.

217
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,545
Through validation confirms that

218
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:37,035
these worst-case failures are handled with only reasonable risk.

219
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:40,670
And this is the main idea behind functional safety.

220
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,190
You focus on worst-case requirements and then implement

221
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,905
hardware and software that can at least handle these worst-case requirements.

222
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:55,680
Finally, let's briefly explore the Safety of Intended Functionality Standard or SOTIF,

223
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,255
which is formally defined in the ISOPAS 21448 document.

224
00:15:02,255 --> 00:15:07,120
SOTIF is specifically concerned with failure causes related to

225
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,115
system performance limitations and predictable misuse of the system.

226
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:17,120
Performance limitations or insufficiencies of the implemented functions due

227
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,070
to technology limitations such as sensor performance limitations and noise,

228
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,330
or limitations of algorithms such as

229
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,825
object detection failures and limitations of actuator technology.

230
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:32,180
Hardware and software failures are addressed by

231
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:38,135
the functional safety standard in ISO 26262 and are out of the scope of SOTIF.

232
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:44,370
SOTIF also addresses unsafe actions due to foreseeable misuse by the user.

233
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,175
Such as user confusion,

234
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,375
user overload and user overconfidence.

235
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,765
The current SOTIF standard targets automation levels,

236
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:54,345
zero, one and two.

237
00:15:54,345 --> 00:15:58,080
It also states that its methods can be applied to levels three,

238
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,275
four, and five autonomy but additional measures may be required.

239
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:07,125
SOTIF can be seen as an extension of the functional safety process,

240
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:12,140
specifically designed to address the challenges of automated driving functions.

241
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:17,035
As such, it follows very much the same V-shaped development philosophy,

242
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:19,300
but with augmented components.

243
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,635
SOTIF also employs HARA to identify

244
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:26,620
the hazards that arise from performance limitations and misuse.

245
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,870
And then performs a similar sequence of design,

246
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,650
unit testing and verification and validation,

247
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,475
to confirm the safety requirements have been met.

248
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:40,075
If you'd like to dive deeper into either the functional safety or SOTIF standards,

249
00:16:40,075 --> 00:16:43,515
please check out the links in the supplemental materials.

250
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:47,270
Let's summarize what we've learned about in this video.

251
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:52,470
We started off with a discussion of generic safety frameworks.

252
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,790
Fault tree analysis as a top-down approach to

253
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,990
safety assessment and failure modes

254
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,450
and effects analysis as a bottom-up approach to safety.

255
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,720
Then we discussed the ideas of functional safety which are used commonly in

256
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,640
software and hardware risk assessments and

257
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,005
discussed SOTIF as an extension to functional safety,

258
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:17,505
that accounts for performance limitations and misuse.

259
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:21,180
All of these ideas are used a lot in the industry,

260
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,480
as we saw with both Waymo and GM which use

261
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,970
nearly all of these techniques in their safety assessments.

262
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,555
Congratulations.

263
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:32,355
You've made it to the end of this safety assessment module.

264
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:35,140
Let's summarize what we learned this week.

265
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:40,520
We started off with discussions on why safety is important specifically how

266
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,325
a broad range of distinct failures can lead to self-driving accidents.

267
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:49,060
Then we formally defined safety concepts and discussed

268
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,345
the NHTASA's safety recommendations for autonomous vehicles.

269
00:17:53,345 --> 00:17:58,670
We then discussed how Waymo and GM think about self-driving safety.

270
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:04,380
Then we described analytic and data-driven approaches to demonstrating safety.

271
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,735
Finally, in today's video,

272
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:09,660
we discussed common safety assessment frameworks.

273
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,275
Including fault trees, failure modes and effects analysis,

274
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:17,115
functional safety and safety of intended functionality.

275
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:20,650
Hopefully, this week give you insight into designing

276
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:25,710
safe self-driving systems and into properly assessing the systems you built.

277
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,670
Before we wrap up this week,

278
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,060
we'll have a discussion with

279
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,200
Professor Krzysztof Czarnecki from the University of Waterloo,

280
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,285
an expert on autonomous safety assessment.

281
00:18:35,285 --> 00:18:39,710
I have lots of interesting questions to ask. Stay tuned.
