[MUSIC]

2
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:18,906
In the last lesson, we developed the
kinematic bicycle model to capture vehicle

3
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:22,530
motion with steering rates and
velocity inputs.

4
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,370
In this lesson, we will move into
the realm of dynamic modeling.

5
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,210
To start taking into account the forces
and moments acting on the vehicle.

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,265
This type of model can lead to
higher fidelity predictions.

7
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:37,275
Than are possible with kinematic models.

8
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:38,245
This higher fidelity,

9
00:00:38,245 --> 00:00:42,205
however, comes at the cost of
higher computational complexity.

10
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:47,525
So both kinematic and dynamic models have
their uses in self driving development.

11
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:50,735
Dynamic modeling is likely
very familiar to many of you.

12
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:53,385
So if you're comfortable
making free body diagrams and

13
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:58,270
applying Newton's equations, Don't
hesitate to jump forward in the course.

14
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,480
If you need a refresher, or

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,125
haven't done dynamic modeling before,
this introductory video is for you.

16
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:07,048
[SOUND] So
why do we need dynamic modeling?

17
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:10,110
In vehicle modeling,
when the vehicle is moving and

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,450
turning at higher speeds, or
when the road is slippery,

19
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,040
the assumptions defined by the no
slip condition may no longer hold.

20
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,700
As the forces exerted on the vehicle cause
the tires to slip over the pavement.

21
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,130
Modeling the balance of forces during slip
conditions can expand the set of driving

22
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,420
conditions for which our model remains
an accurate prediction of motion.

23
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,520
Also, many sub systems in the car have
similar conditions where a hard kinematic

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,020
constraint is not correctly captured
the evolution of that sub system, and

25
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,560
dynamic models are needed there as well.

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,870
An example would be the drive train for

27
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,380
which the balance of torques is needed
to capture the connection from throttle

28
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,880
position to wheel torque through
the engine and transmission systems.

29
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,510
By explicitly modeling the balance of
forces in moments acting on the vehicle,

30
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,900
we can determine the accelerations
the vehicle is experiencing and

31
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,610
use them to model our vehicle motion.

32
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,600
We now turn to the task of defining
the dynamic modelling process for

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,280
a rigid body.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,110
To build a typical dynamic model,
we can follow the following steps.

35
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,100
First we set up the coordinate
frames to be used in the model.

36
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,680
For example, the body frame and
the inertial frame we discussed before.

37
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,950
Next, we break down the dynamic
system into lumped dynamic elements.

38
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,870
These elements combine potentially
distributed aspects of the system

39
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,510
into discrete or lumped elements.

40
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,630
In the case of a spring mass damper,
the lumped elements would be the spring,

41
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,980
the mass, and the damper.

42
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,250
We also define a model for
each lumped element.

43
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,410
For example, the linear spring provides
a force proportional to a displacement for

44
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,320
a resting position.

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,240
Next, we sketch the free body diagram for
each rigid body in the list of elements.

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,550
And properly name and model all the forces
and moments acting on the body.

47
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,980
Finally, by using Newton's second law,

48
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,260
we write the mathematical equations
that define our dynamic model,

49
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,950
summing all forces along each axis for
translational dynamics.

50
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,010
In all moments about each rotational
axis for rotational dynamics.

51
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,750
The result is an ordinary
differential equation describing

52
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,240
the motion of our rigid body and
this is our dynamic model.

53
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,610
Let's follow our four step process for

54
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,370
a one dimensional translational system,
a rolling cart.

55
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,460
This figure shows the cart of mass m
whose position we'd like to track.

56
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,940
We start by defining
the coordinate frame for

57
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,520
the position of the cart, denoted with x.

58
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:00,060
Then we identify the rigid body, which
is in this case, is the cart of mass m.

59
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,250
Next, we draw a free body diagram and

60
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,430
define all of the forces
acting on the carts.

61
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,220
In this case, there were three
forces acting on the cart,

62
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,400
f1 pulling the cart to the right, and
f2 and f3 pulling the cart to the left.

63
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:20,220
Finally, we apply Newton's second law in
the x direction to form the dynamic model.

64
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,240
The resulting dynamic equation
describing the motion of the carts

65
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,420
Is m times the acceleration in the x
direction denoted by x double dot

66
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,140
is equal to the summation of f1,
f2, and f3.

67
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,810
Note that f2 and f3

68
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,320
have negative signs due to the fact that
they point in the negative x direction.

69
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,990
The same process can be applied for
a shock absorber in a car

70
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,180
The dynamic model of a shock absorber
helps the engineers to design and

71
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,630
tune the vehicle suspension for
better ride comfort and driveability.

72
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,130
To model this component,

73
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:01,350
we can go through the same four steps that
we introduced in the previous slides.

74
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,380
We again set up the coordinate system,

75
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,720
which in this case is one coordinate
y in the vertical direction.

76
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,380
The identified of rigid bodies or
lump dynamic elements.

77
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,150
In the case of a real physical system,

78
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,560
there is notion of lump
element very important.

79
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,750
The shock absorber relies
on it's spring and

80
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,670
hydraulics cylinder with flow
restriction to absorb shocks.

81
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,540
We model this system as
three separate long elements

82
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,570
A mass a spring and
hydraulic cylinder or damper.

83
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,750
We use a linear spring and damper model
where the spring resist displacement in y

84
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,940
and damper resist the y velocity.

85
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,180
The third step is sketching
the free body diagram.

86
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,330
Normally we show the forces Or

87
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,840
torques along with the velocities and
directions in this diagram.

88
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,040
Finally, we form the dynamic equation,

89
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,260
which in this case is the famous second
order spring mass damper equation.

90
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,139
There is no variation in this process to
handle rotational or torsional systems.

91
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,880
Rotational systems are very common in the
automobile with examples like the internal

92
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,990
combustion engine chaps, gear boxes,
[INAUDIBLE] converters and tires.

93
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,450
In a rotational system,

94
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,940
we sum the [INAUDIBLE] about each
access of rotation and lump.

95
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,810
Inertia is J, torsional springs and

96
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,479
dampers in the same way as
in the translational case.

97
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,610
We refer to the rotational
acceleration of a rigid body as alpha.

98
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,090
Let's model the rotational
dynamics of a wheel,

99
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,280
using our four-step modeling process.

100
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,310
First, we set up the coordinate system.

101
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,710
One coordinate in the rotational direction
is enough to represent the wheel's motion.

102
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,780
We defined theta as the angular
position of the wheel, with theta dot

103
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,740
as its rotation rate and theta double dot,
its angular acceleration.

104
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,760
Next, we formed the lumped
dynamic elements.

105
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,620
The tire model has rotational
inertia J due to its rotating mass.

106
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,220
And torsional stiffness k and

107
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,530
damping b, defined by the material
properties of the tire in the wheel hub.

108
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,620
We drive the wheel with the a drive torque
from the vehicles drive shaft and resist

109
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,739
this with a load torque coming from the
tires interaction with the road's surface.

110
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,670
Now we sketch the freebody diagram.

111
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,650
The drive torque and low torque
are defined in opposite directions

112
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,860
as the load resists the drive
torque's acceleration of the wheel.

113
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,610
We can now form the dynamic model for
the wheel system.

114
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,610
The difference between
the drive torque and

115
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,200
the load torque define the net
torque acting on the wheel.

116
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,720
While the rotational spring and

117
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,130
the damper from the lump element
models resist the acceleration.

118
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,150
The final dynamic model describes
how the wheels position changes

119
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,609
when subject to this net torque.

120
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,940
Dynamic models of vehicles are useful for
multiple applications.

121
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,870
They can be used to improve
state estimation methods

122
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,900
when fusing sensor data to track motion.

123
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,270
They can be used to aid in
controller design to track a desired

124
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,259
trajectory or path.

125
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,800
And they can help self-driving engineers
define the limits of vehicle performance

126
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,540
to avoid from planning unsafe
trajectories that a car cannot track.

127
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,290
However, a full three-dimensional
model of the vehicle,

128
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,110
taking into account body roll and pitch.

129
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,230
And arbitrarily inclined roads,
and different forces and

130
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,720
moments at each tire makes for
a very complex model.

131
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:43,990
Instead, it's possible to separate our
model into two 2D models that split our

132
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,639
vehicle control into a steering control
and a throttle and brake control problem.

133
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,280
Full 3D vehicle modeling
is a fascinating field.

134
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,940
And we've introduced some links in
the supplementary materials if you'd like

135
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,490
to learn more.

136
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,420
For these reasons,
we'll build a separate longitudinal and

137
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,790
lateral dynamic model for
our self-driving car.

138
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,679
The longitudinal model considers
a vehicle traveling on an inclined road.

139
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,130
We restrict the vehicle
motion to the XZ plane.

140
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,360
There are several forces
acting on the vehicle body and

141
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,550
tires, including the Traction force,
the Rolling resistance,

142
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,910
Aerodynamic force, and
Gradient resistance force due to gravity.

143
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,960
In the next video we'll go through
the Longitudinal Vehicle Dynamics model,

144
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,760
in more detail.

145
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:37,416
Similarly, the Lateral Vehicle Dynamics
model,

146
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,900
can be developed from
motion in the xy plane.

147
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,970
When looking at the vehicle from
the top down or birds eye view.

148
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,500
In this 2D model there is also several
forces in the lateral direction

149
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,030
acting on the vehicle such as the slip
forces and centrifugal forces,

150
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:00,090
this topic would be discuss in
the future lesson as well in this video

151
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:06,910
we cover the basic of 2D dynamic model and
apply it to a server and wheel subsystem.

152
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,100
These models are helpful in determining
how those systems evolved over time.

153
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,610
In the next lesson we will cover
the vehicle longitudinal dynamics.

154
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:21,130
And study the drive train components
that provide tweak to the drive wheels.

155
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:21,750
Will see there.
