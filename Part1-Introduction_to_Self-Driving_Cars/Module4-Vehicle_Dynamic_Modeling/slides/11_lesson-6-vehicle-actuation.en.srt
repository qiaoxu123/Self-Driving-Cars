1
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,010
In this lesson, we will go over the basics of

2
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,600
the vehicle actuation system such as throttling, braking, and steering.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,055
By the end of this video,

4
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:24,700
you will be able to;

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,930
define common models for the steering, throttle,

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,010
and brake systems of the vehicle and connect

7
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,405
these models to the vehicle dynamic equations derived in the previous videos.

8
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:40,985
Let's get started. The main input to the lateral dynamics is steering angle

9
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:43,640
and the main inputs to the longitudinal dynamics

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,910
are throttle pedal position and brake pedal position.

11
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,035
These inputs define some of the forces and moments that act on the vehicle

12
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:55,940
and feed into the ordinary differential equations that govern the state of the vehicle.

13
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,985
Note that the lateral dynamics and the longitudinal dynamics can affect each other.

14
00:01:00,985 --> 00:01:05,510
Although the models we have built so far are separated by assumption.

15
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,310
The lateral forces and moments then drive the vehicle lateral kinematics,

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,855
which produce a vehicle lateral velocity in your rate.

17
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:18,800
Similarly, the longitudinal forces drive the longitudinal kinematics,

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,595
which defines the resulting forward velocity and displacement.

19
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:26,330
The main task of vehicle control is to provide

20
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,330
suitable steering throttle and brake commands to keep

21
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,895
the vehicle on the desired path and following a desired speed profile.

22
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:38,750
We'll assume these desired elements are provided by the motion planning system and

23
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:44,220
we'll see how to build such a planner in the fourth course of this specialization.

24
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,200
Now, let's turn to modeling each of

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,645
the three command inputs subsystems to further refine our full vehicle model.

26
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,570
First, let's take a look at the steering model.

27
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,390
The steering model is simply the driver's command or

28
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,305
the autonomy systems command to turn the vehicle to the right or left.

29
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:07,480
The steering angle is translated into a wheel angle through a special mechanism

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,835
and gear ratios that provide the lateral forces to keep the vehicle on a curved path.

31
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:15,495
In the simplest model for the steering system,

32
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:18,610
the wheel angle can be defined as proportional to the steering angle.

33
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,520
So, the steering angle Delta S,

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,705
is linearly proportional to the wheel angle Delta,

35
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:28,520
with a steering coefficient C. This is sufficient for

36
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,245
our work in simulation and is often used as a starting point for non-aggressive driving.

37
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:38,625
In reality, the steering system is more complex than the previous simple formulation and

38
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,090
a fully dynamic model may be needed if

39
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,050
steering commands are very near the bandwidth of the steering assembly.

40
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,660
This figure shows the main subsystem in a steering assembly such as the steering wheel,

41
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,795
steering column, steering gears and linkages

42
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:57,520
that connect the steering column to the left and right wheels.

43
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,600
This figure also shows the rack and pinion gears on the right which translate

44
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,730
the rotational motion of the steering wheel to

45
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,850
the linear motions needed to move the wheel linkages.

46
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,300
We've included links to more detailed dynamic models of

47
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,980
steering assemblies in the supplemental materials if you'd like to learn more.

48
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,740
Next up is the power train model.

49
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,290
As we saw earlier in this module,

50
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,585
the vehicle power train determines the vehicles forward velocity and acceleration.

51
00:03:26,585 --> 00:03:29,030
In automatic transmission cars,

52
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,475
a driver or the autonomy system has two inputs to accelerate or decelerate the vehicle,

53
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:36,215
the gas, and brake.

54
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:39,770
This diagram shows the mechanism to translate

55
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,880
the driver or autonomy systems commands into wheel motions.

56
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,335
Let's now look at the typical power flow through the power train.

57
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:53,135
Let's review the power flow diagram from the longitudinal dynamics video.

58
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:55,400
The power flow diagram starts from

59
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,410
the power generation unit such as the internal combustion engine or electric motor.

60
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,155
A throttle pedal position drives the torque produced by the power generation unit.

61
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:09,520
This torque is passed to the transmission system.

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,640
In an automatic transmission system,

63
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,345
the fluid coupling system or torque converter

64
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:18,185
is placed between the engine shafts and the gearbox unit.

65
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:22,135
Then, based on the operating mode and desired speeds,

66
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:24,785
the gearbox changes the gear as needed.

67
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:29,540
Gears one and two are torque modes and the higher gears are called speed modes,

68
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,230
referring to the different modes of operation in the torque converter.

69
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,990
Then the power flows to the wheels through

70
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,570
a differential and generates the wheel torques,

71
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,735
which ultimately generate traction forces.

72
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:45,140
The traction force must be higher than the resistance force,

73
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,600
which includes the aerodynamic force and

74
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,520
road friction to accelerate the vehicle forward in the longitudinal direction.

75
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,050
The power which is the source of the vehicle motion can be generated through

76
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,105
combustion in an internal combustion engine or from the battery for an electric motor.

77
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:05,330
Simply put, the driver puts their foot on the gas pedal to

78
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,410
define the level of torque demand needed to accelerate the vehicle.

79
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,560
The actual response is a bit more complex

80
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,310
and depends on the type of power generation unit involved.

81
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,955
The characteristics of the internal combustion engine,

82
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:23,270
diesel engines, and electric motors are all different.

83
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,450
The torque-speed diagram is used as a diagram

84
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,115
to represent these characteristics for power units.

85
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:34,940
The left diagram shows a torque-speed curve for a gas engine.

86
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,705
For a range of engine angular speeds are RPMs.

87
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,860
The highest torque operating point for a gas engine tends to be in

88
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,375
the middle RPMs typically 2,000 or 3,000 RPM for a passenger vehicle engine.

89
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,420
At low and high speeds,

90
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,005
the ability of the engine to produce torque falls off.

91
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:59,420
The middle diagram is a torque characteristic for the diesel engines,

92
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,935
which show more consistent torque generation over a wider range of speeds.

93
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:06,620
This is why diesel engines are more suitable for

94
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,660
heavy-duty vehicles and the gasoline engines are best suited for small and city cars.

95
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,735
The right diagram shows the torque characteristic of an electric motor.

96
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:22,730
The electric motor is more efficient at lower RPMs such as 1,500.

97
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,835
However, it is not very efficient at higher RPM.

98
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:28,100
Note that to compensate the lack of

99
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,880
torque characteristics at the higher RPM in electric motors,

100
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,300
the hybrid electric vehicles use the internal combustion engine

101
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,725
to improve performance over electric motors at higher speeds.

102
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:43,190
The torque characteristic plots of an internal combustion engine

103
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,310
at different throttle angles is plotted in this figure.

104
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,930
The torque to RPM relation can be represented as

105
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,865
a second-order polynomial which is a simple but fairly good control, oriented model.

106
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:56,390
In the following equations,

107
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,105
the engine torque is represented as Te.

108
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:02,390
The throttle pedal position is X-Theta and

109
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,975
the engine angular speed is Omega e. The coefficients,

110
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:12,380
A knot, A_1 and A_2 are identified and tuned for different engines.

111
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,800
This model is called a semi-empirical model,

112
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,330
and more detailed models can include the dynamics of fluids,

113
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,170
heat transfer, combustion and

114
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,800
many other phenomena which are not in the scope of this course.

115
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,710
Given the engine speed and throttle position,

116
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:33,530
it is possible to compute the engine torque produced based on this semi-empirical map,

117
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,865
which then feeds into the longitudinal dynamics model for the vehicle.

118
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:42,170
Let's now turn to model development for the brake system.

119
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,730
The braking process starts from the driver commanded brake pedal position,

120
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:51,695
which is translated into a brake pressure by the electronic control unit.

121
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:56,590
The brake pressure results in a braking force on the brake disc or drum,

122
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,465
which becomes a braking wheel torque at the wheel.

123
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:01,730
The braking torque on the wheels creates

124
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,720
a negative longitudinal force to decelerate the vehicle.

125
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,710
Because of the control unit management of the braking torque,

126
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,265
the response to the braking system is very predictable.

127
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:15,020
For the purposes of this course,

128
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,160
it is not necessary to model the brakes in much detail and once again,

129
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,785
a simple linear mapping from pedal position to brake torque can be used.

130
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:25,880
The braking system is of course,

131
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,625
vital to control the motion of a vehicle.

132
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:33,335
In fact, brakes play a range of important roles in vehicle control.

133
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:35,810
Some of the primary functions of a braking system

134
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:40,360
include: shortening stopping distance through hard braking,

135
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,635
maintaining steerability during braking through anti-lock braking,

136
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:48,945
maintaining stability during braking to avoid overturning.

137
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:54,745
These functions help to expand the set of safe operating conditions that we can drive in

138
00:08:54,745 --> 00:08:57,250
and modern braking capabilities have led to

139
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,280
significant advances in vehicle safety and performance.

140
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,755
We've now completed our discussion of the actuator components of the vehicle.

141
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,365
Let's summarize what we've done so far.

142
00:09:08,365 --> 00:09:12,190
In this video, we looked at the vehicle actuation system and

143
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,410
the main commands used to move the vehicle in

144
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,870
both the lateral and longitudinal directions.

145
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,220
In the autonomous car,

146
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,810
these actuation signals will be the main output of the vehicle control module.

147
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,020
We also developed steering,

148
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,250
engine and brake models that convert

149
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,060
these commands into wheel angles and torques on the wheels.

150
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,445
In the next video,

151
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:36,695
we will go through the final piece of our dynamic vehicle modeling process.

152
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:41,250
The tire that connects the vehicle to the road. See you there.
