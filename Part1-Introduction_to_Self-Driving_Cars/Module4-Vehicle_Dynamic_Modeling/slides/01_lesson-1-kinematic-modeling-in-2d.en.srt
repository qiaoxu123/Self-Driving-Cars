1
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:24,960
In this module, we will cover kinematic and dynamic modeling of an autonomous car.

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,805
Creating a good vehicle model is essential for model-based control development.

3
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:31,260
We'll look at modeling,

4
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,500
both the evolution of the kinematics, that is,

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,910
positions and velocities, and the dynamics or

6
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,720
forces and torques of a car and how they connect.

7
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,700
Later on in the next modules,

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,625
we will use these vehicle models extensively for controller design.

9
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:55,265
In this module, you will study the basics of coordinate frames and kinematics,

10
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:59,705
develop a kinematic model for cars known as the bicycle model,

11
00:00:59,705 --> 00:01:03,115
explore the basics of dynamic modeling,

12
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:07,820
develop a longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamic mode,

13
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,790
create actuator models for steering,

14
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:16,565
throttle and break, and finally study tire slip and tire modeling.

15
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:18,545
So, let's get started.

16
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,260
Generally, vehicle motion can be modeled

17
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,200
either by considering the geometric constraint that

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,980
defines its motion or by considering all of the forces and moments acting on a vehicle.

19
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,270
The first case is known as Kinematic Modeling.

20
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,355
Especially at low speeds when the accelerations are not significant,

21
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:41,870
Kinematic Modeling is more than sufficient to capture the motion of a vehicle.

22
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,595
When we instead include knowledge of the forces and moments acting on the vehicle,

23
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:49,010
we're performing Dynamic Modeling.

24
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,160
Dynamic models can do a great job of estimating

25
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,445
vehicle motion throughout the vehicles operating range,

26
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:59,310
but are more involved to develop than kinematic models.

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,720
Before we start modeling vehicle motion,

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,830
it's important to review the concepts of Coordinate Frame Transformations.

29
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,790
We'll start with 2D transformations in this video and you'll see

30
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:16,085
more on 3D transformations in the second course on state estimation.

31
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:20,920
The coordinate frames we use are right-handed frames by convention,

32
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,885
and we'll use a few standard coordinate frames throughout the specialization.

33
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:29,770
The global world or inertial coordinate frame,

34
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,780
is a fixed reference frame attached to the earth.

35
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,780
Often, we'll represent this coordinate frame as East North Up,

36
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,060
ENU, relative to a reference point nearby.

37
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,370
Or Earth-Centered Earth Fixed,

38
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,405
ECEF, as is used in GNSS systems.

39
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:49,690
The next frame we'll talk about is the body frame,

40
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,125
which is placed in some key location on the body of the vehicle.

41
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:58,715
For example, the center of gravity of a vehicle or the center point of the rear axle.

42
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:01,885
This frame is moving and rotating with respect

43
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:05,590
to the fixed inertial frame as the vehicle moves about.

44
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,075
Finally, the sensor frame is a coordinate frame which attaches to

45
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:14,935
each sensor describing the coordinates used for the sensor output.

46
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:17,695
In many robotics applications,

47
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:20,420
we need to attach several coordinates to

48
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:26,515
a moving system and also represent elements from these frames in the inertial frame.

49
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:31,615
To do this, we need to transform variables from one coordinate frame to the other.

50
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:35,435
For example, from the body frame to the inertial.

51
00:03:35,435 --> 00:03:41,950
Even a simple two wheeled robot with a single sensor has three such frames to consider,

52
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,500
while the self-driving car can have dozens.

53
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,779
To maintain a consistent representation of sensor data for perception,

54
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:54,250
we need to be able to transform information between coordinate frames.

55
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,900
Let's take a look at a simple transformation example for a velocity vector of a car.

56
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,440
Generally, kinematic variables such as velocity are represented in the form of a vector,

57
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,320
with both magnitude and direction.

58
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,410
In this figure, the vector v is presented with

59
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,215
a green arrow in a two-dimensional coordinate frame.

60
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:16,885
We have two coordinate frames displayed here.

61
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:20,480
The body frame, defined by axes b_1 and b_2,

62
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,965
and the inertial frame defined by axes e_1 and e_2,

63
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:26,165
both in the 2D plane.

64
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,800
Let's assume the two coordinate frames;

65
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,530
frame e and frame b,

66
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,530
have the same fixed origin.

67
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,715
But frame b is rotated by some angle Theta relative to frame

68
00:04:36,715 --> 00:04:41,649
e. We can then define the rotational matrices C_EB,

69
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:46,555
which transforms vectors from the frame b to the frame e and

70
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:53,135
C_BE which projects the frame e onto frame b using the angle Theta as shown.

71
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:57,440
Now, let's extend our example to include a translation.

72
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,550
Here, we see a two-wheeled robot and we'd like to represent the position of

73
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,270
a point P observed by the robot in the robot body frame b,

74
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,500
with respect to the inertial frame e.

75
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,790
The position of the robot with respect to the inertial frame is x and y,

76
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,485
and the orientation of the robot once again is Theta.

77
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:22,080
The following equations relate the location of point P in

78
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,890
the body coordinates P_B and the inertial frame P_E.

79
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,030
Note that in general to transform

80
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,260
one point from one coordinate to the other coordinate frame,

81
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,785
body to inertial and vice versa, requires two terms.

82
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:42,885
The translation of the origin O_BE and O_EB in this case,

83
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:48,550
and the rotation of the axis C_EB and C_BE.

84
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,250
Finally, we can summarize the transformation between

85
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,610
two coordinate frames using homogeneous coordinates,

86
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,470
which lead to a compact matrix multiplication to apply the transformation.

87
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,370
We extend our location vector to include x, y,

88
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,860
and one and can then transform from body to inertial coordinates using P

89
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:17,380
inertial is C_EB and O_EB times P in the body frame.

90
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,920
We're now ready to start kinematic modeling of a simple robot.

91
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,290
The robot's motion is constrained to move

92
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,900
forward because its wheels point in this direction.

93
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,334
This constraint is called a nonholonomic constraint,

94
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:34,825
which means that it restricts the rate of change of the position of our robot.

95
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:38,840
So, our robot can roll forward and turn while rolling,

96
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,255
but cannot move sideways directly.

97
00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:46,200
We'll use this constraint to define a kinematic model for our robot.

98
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,935
The velocity of the robot is defined by the tangent vector to its path.

99
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:55,855
Let's define the orientation angle of the robot as Theta.

100
00:06:55,855 --> 00:07:00,465
Then the tan of Theta can be written as dy over dx.

101
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:02,870
The velocity of the robot in the y-direction

102
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,160
divided by the velocity of the robot in the x-direction.

103
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,750
By rearranging the above equation,

104
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:14,030
we can derive an expression for the nonholonomic constraint equation as follows.

105
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,790
We can then construct a pair of equations for

106
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,500
the motion of the robot by combining these equations.

107
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,495
The velocity of the robot in the x-direction,

108
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:28,535
is the magnitude of the velocity vector v multiplied by cosine of Theta.

109
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:31,840
In the y-direction is v sine of Theta.

110
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,380
Lastly, we can assume the direct control over the robots rate of change of heading.

111
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,950
We've now successfully built a kinematic model for our robot.

112
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,350
This model takes as input the forward velocity in

113
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,165
rotation rate and represents the robot using a vector of three states,

114
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:53,620
the x and y position of the robot and it's heading.

115
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,755
Throughout this course, we will work with state-based models.

116
00:07:57,755 --> 00:08:00,530
Let's define what we mean by a state.

117
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,220
A state is a set of variables often arranged in the form of

118
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,100
a vector that fully describe the system at the current time.

119
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,355
Returning to our robot,

120
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:16,735
the input of the model are velocity v and rate of change of orientation Omega.

121
00:08:16,735 --> 00:08:19,645
However, for the actual two-wheel robot,

122
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:24,575
it's also possible we need to directly command wheel velocities as inputs.

123
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,830
We'll now look at how to extend our model and relate

124
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,230
each wheel rotational velocity to forward velocity,

125
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,595
v, and rotation rate Omega.

126
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:38,000
We'll need a few more variables defined as follows.

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,200
P is the center of the robot,

128
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,265
L is the distance from the center of the robot to each of its wheels,

129
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:49,714
R is the radius of the wheels,

130
00:08:49,714 --> 00:08:55,295
w_1 and w_2 are the left and right wheel angular speeds.

131
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,790
The velocity of the robot at each wheel is

132
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,120
the radius of the wheel times its rotational velocity.

133
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,240
So, v equals r times w_i.

134
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,995
We can do this by assuming no slip between the wheel and the surface.

135
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:12,650
The velocity of the robot can be computed as

136
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,715
the average velocity of both wheels as seen from this figure.

137
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:19,730
When the velocities of both wheels are the same,

138
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,695
the robot moves in a straight line.

139
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,780
If the wheel velocities are different,

140
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:29,630
the robot moves in a curved path about some instantaneous center of rotation or ICR.

141
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:35,720
We'll now use the notion of ICR to define the kinematic model for our two wheeled robot.

142
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,740
We again have that the rotation rate Omega,

143
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,780
is equal to v over r,

144
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,570
and can use similar triangles to define two expressions for

145
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,000
Omega in terms of v_2 and Rho, and v_1,

146
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,190
v_2 and L. Combining these equations with our expression for

147
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,920
velocities v_1 and v_2 in terms of

148
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,260
the wheel rotation speeds yields

149
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,390
the final form of the equation for the rotation rate of the robot.

150
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:08,810
We now return to our original robot model and substitute in

151
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:13,505
the new expressions for the velocity and rotation rate of the two wheeled robot.

152
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:18,110
We can see that the inputs of this model are w_1 and w_2,

153
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,060
which are the wheel's angular speeds.

154
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,080
The state remains the same for both robots.

155
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,810
Also by discretizing the continuous time equations,

156
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,930
we can convert our model from the differential form to a finite difference form.

157
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,920
This form is convenient for controller design as we'll see shortly,

158
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,415
as well as for simulation and state estimation purposes.

159
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:45,730
Note that the subscript k means the value of the variables at the current time step,

160
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:51,780
and the subscript k plus 1 will refer to values of the variables at the next time step.

161
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,285
To summarize, in this lesson we covered 2D coordinate frames and transformations.

162
00:10:58,285 --> 00:11:03,710
We also covered continuous and discrete kinematic models for a two-wheeled robot.

163
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,790
In the next video, we'll develop a kinematic bicycle model,

164
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,489
a convenient and compact tool for representing

165
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:14,200
a self-driving car's motion. See you next time.
