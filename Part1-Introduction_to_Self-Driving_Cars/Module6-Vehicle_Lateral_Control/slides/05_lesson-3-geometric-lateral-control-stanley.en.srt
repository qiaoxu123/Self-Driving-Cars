00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,115
Welcome back. In the last lesson,

2
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:19,800
we derived the pure pursuit controller,

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,500
a geometric path tracking controller that defined

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,950
steering input based on a look ahead reference point.

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,855
In this lesson, we will cover

6
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:31,965
a second geometric path tracking controller, the Stanley controller.

7
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,630
This controller was used by

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,755
the Stanford racing team to win the second Darpa Grand Challenge event.

9
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:40,045
Specifically in this video,

10
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:43,880
you will derive the Stanley geometric controller,

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,144
analyze the evolution of its steering commands for small and large errors,

12
00:00:49,144 --> 00:00:52,580
and evaluate the control performance in the form of

13
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,305
convergence to the desired path from arbitrary starting conditions.

14
00:00:57,305 --> 00:01:00,530
Let's get started. The Stanley controller is

15
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,755
a geometric path tracking controller which is simple

16
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:07,595
but useful for autonomous robotics and autonomous cars.

17
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:10,715
The method was originally developed by Gabe Hoffman,

18
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:13,369
a fellow lab-mate of mine at Stanford University

19
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:16,670
as his contribution to the winning teams entry,

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,715
and is named after the vehicle Stanley.

21
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:24,230
The main concept that went into the creation of the Stanley controller

22
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,370
was that a change in the reference position could lead to different,

23
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,580
possibly more desirable properties of the control.

24
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,810
Dr. Hoffman was seeking a control law with global convergence to

25
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,345
the path and predictable decay of the errors that would be independent of vehicle speed.

26
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:44,270
So, one day in a fit of inspiration,

27
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,460
Dr. Hoffman switched the vehicle reference point used for the controller to the center of

28
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,790
the front axle instead of either the CG or

29
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,800
the rear axle to see how this new controller might behave.

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,030
The next modifications he added were to consider

31
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,435
both heading alignment and cross track error without a look-ahead distance,

32
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:07,030
but directly at the reference point.

33
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,370
Finally, the Stanley controller caps its outputs to

34
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,745
fall within the limits of the maximum steering angle.

35
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:19,350
In all these three considerations formed the basis for the resulting control law.

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,375
Let's define each of the terms of the Stanley controller.

37
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,310
In this diagram, you can see

38
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,810
the slight modifications to the relevant terms based on the Stanley assumptions.

39
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,800
The cross track error is measured relative to the front axle,

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,060
and the reference point on the path has no look ahead distance associated with it.

41
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,025
Let's make each of the three components of the Stanley controller more concrete.

42
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:47,029
First, to eliminate heading error relative to the path,

43
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:50,990
the steering angle is set equal to the heading directly.

44
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,289
Then to eliminate cross track error,

45
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:56,599
a proportional control is added,

46
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,290
whose gain is scaled by the inverse of the forward velocity.

47
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,700
The control is then passed through an inverse tan function which maps

48
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,880
the proportional control signal to the angular range of minus Pi to Pi.

49
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,055
Finally, the steering angle command is kept

50
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:15,800
to fall within the minimum and maximum steering angles,

51
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,810
Delta min and Delta max,

52
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,920
which are usually symmetric about 0.

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,280
The similarities with the pure pursuit controller are not surprising,

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,290
as both are seeking to perform the same task with the same kinematic model.

55
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,230
The Stanley controller scales its gains by

56
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,160
the forward speed in the same way as pure pursuit control,

57
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,040
and also has the same inverse tangent of the proportional control signal.

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,540
However, the independent penalization of heading and cross track errors and

59
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,880
the elimination of the look-ahead distance

60
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,305
make this a different approach from pure pursuit.

61
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:56,060
The final control law simply combines

62
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,545
these three elements to set the steering angle of the car as follows.

63
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:06,065
Let's now take a look at what's steering angle is requested for different error signals.

64
00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:09,470
For heading error, the steering command points

65
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,260
in the opposite direction to the heading error,

66
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,700
causing the vehicle to turn to correct the misalignment with the path.

67
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,220
For large heading errors, for example,

68
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,460
if the heading error exceeds the maximum steering angle,

69
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,350
this part of the controller requests

70
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:30,140
the maximum steering command until alignment falls back within the available balance.

71
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,920
For large positive cross track error,

72
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:39,305
ke over vf becomes large and the inverse tangent approaches Pi over 2.

73
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:45,365
So we can approximate the Stanley control law as the heading error plus Pi over 2.

74
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:48,620
This large value clamps the steering command to the

75
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,265
maximum and the vehicle turns towards the path.

76
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:56,930
The effect of this term is to increase the heading error in the opposite direction,

77
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,180
and so the steering command will drop to

78
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,455
0 once the heading error reaches minus Pi over 2.

79
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:09,290
The vehicle then proceeds straight to the path until the cross track error decreases.

80
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,260
At this point, the heading term starts correcting

81
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,930
the alignment with the path again and ultimately,

82
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,950
the vehicle starts to track the path more closely.

83
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,460
But how does this control actually converge to the path?

84
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,580
As it turns out, it's possible to use

85
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,970
our expression for the cross track aerodynamics defined in

86
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,700
the first video of this module to get a sense

87
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,090
for the convergence characteristics of the Stanley controller.

88
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,690
Recall that the rate of change of the cross track error for

89
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,760
a front axle reference point is equal to minus the forward velocity,

90
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,880
times the sine of the heading minus the steering angle.

91
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,960
If we substitute in the Stanley control law without limits,

92
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,260
we get the final expression in this equation.

93
00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:00,050
Using a trigonometric identity for simplifying the sign of the inverse of 10,

94
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,340
we can find that the rate of change of the cross track error evolves according

95
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,540
to minus the gain k times the cross track error,

96
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:14,205
divided by the square root of 1 plus ke over vf squared.

97
00:06:14,205 --> 00:06:16,755
For small cross track errors,

98
00:06:16,755 --> 00:06:19,280
we can simplify the denominator of this expression

99
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,655
by assuming the quadratic term is negligible.

100
00:06:22,655 --> 00:06:25,460
This leads to the realization that

101
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,530
the cross track error evolution follows a first-order differential equation,

102
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,480
and the solution for this ODE is an exponential.

103
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,355
Since k is positive,

104
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:40,130
we see that the error decays exponentially to 0.

105
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,580
The most interesting aspect of this investigation is that

106
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,630
the decay rate is completely independent of the speed.

107
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,340
So faster vehicles will travel farther while converging to the path,

108
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,665
but will converge to the path at the same time as slower moving vehicles.

109
00:06:57,665 --> 00:07:02,480
Let's now dive into a simulation example of the error dynamics for

110
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,025
the Stanley controller to observe its convergence characteristics.

111
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:11,780
In this example, let's take a look at two extreme scenarios,

112
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:17,030
large initial cross track error and large initial heading error.

113
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,665
In the first case,

114
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:20,930
for large initial cross track error,

115
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,190
let's assume the initial cross track error is five meters,

116
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,870
and that the maximum allowable steering angle is

117
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,950
25 degrees and the forward velocity is five meters per second.

118
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,980
We'll set the vehicle wheel base length to one meter for

119
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,525
simplicity and the gain k will be set to a value of 2.5.

120
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,120
This was selected based on chosen parameters for

121
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,270
the simulation and some trial and error testing.

122
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,990
The simulation shows how the Stanley controller corrects

123
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,710
for a large cross track error and converges to the desired path.

124
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,870
The large initial error leads to

125
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,280
a large steering command that quickly turns the vehicle towards the path.

126
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,210
The heading error and cross track error terms then reach an equilibrium,

127
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,930
and the vehicle continues in a straight line towards the path.

128
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,530
As the cross track error decreases,

129
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,630
the exponential decay to the path becomes visible.

130
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:17,075
Finally, the vehicle safely tracks the path in the final stages of the simulation.

131
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:21,530
We can also run the same simulation at different forward velocities.

132
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,270
So, let's try speeds of two,

133
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,565
five and 10 meters per second.

134
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:29,795
The results show the main characteristics of the Stanley controller.

135
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:32,900
In all cases, the turn towards the path,

136
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,535
straight line progress and then exponential decay to the path are visible.

137
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:39,290
The higher the speed,

138
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,380
the further the car travels before reaching the path.

139
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,420
But the final convergence for

140
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,485
small cross track errors takes the same amount of time in each case.

141
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:49,970
In the second case,

142
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,965
the simulation can be regenerated for the scenario at a large initial heading error.

143
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:58,610
The parameters are the same as the previous case but the vehicle

144
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,840
starts out on the path pointing very much in the wrong direction.

145
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,045
The simulation results show the heading error is corrected by the Stanley control law.

146
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:13,475
First, the steering command is up against its limit as the heading error is corrected.

147
00:09:13,475 --> 00:09:16,670
Then as the cross track error starts to grow,

148
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,010
the steering commands continue to correct

149
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,245
the heading of the car beyond the alignment with the path.

150
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:26,930
Finally, the car enters the exponential convergence segment as before.

151
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,350
These simulation results give us a good idea of the ability of

152
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,935
the Stanley controller to correct arbitrarily large errors.

153
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:37,520
In fact, it comes with a global stability proof,

154
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,950
meaning that no matter what the initial conditions,

155
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,100
the controller will guide the car back to its path.

156
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,980
In practice however, the Stanley controller is

157
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,820
still a geometric path tracking controller,

158
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:54,185
and as such does not consider many different aspects of real self-driving car.

159
00:09:54,185 --> 00:09:57,850
For example, it does not consider noisy measurements,

160
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,890
actuator dynamics or tire force effects,

161
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:05,600
all of which can cause undesirable ride characteristics during maneuvers.

162
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,400
It is possible, however,

163
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,130
to make a few adjustments to the geometric path tracking

164
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:15,720
controllers that help mitigate some of these most undesirable effects.

165
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,690
During low-speed operation, the pure pursuit and Stanley controllers can behave

166
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:25,150
quite aggressively when confronted with noisy velocity estimates.

167
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:30,875
Since the velocity term is in the denominator of the fraction inside the inverse tangent,

168
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:35,375
errors in low speed estimates tend to get amplified in the steering command.

169
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,839
This leads to wild swings in the steering wheel,

170
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,105
which is not desirable for rider comfort.

171
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:46,520
So to get rid of this issue and to increase the stability of our solution at low speeds,

172
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,265
we add a positive softening constant

173
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:52,970
that ensures the denominator always has a minimum value.

174
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,495
This softening constant can be tuned in the field.

175
00:10:56,495 --> 00:11:00,350
At higher speeds, we have the issue that steering commands need to

176
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,045
vary slowly to ensure lateral forces are not excessive.

177
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:06,380
Even with this scaling on speeds,

178
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,130
Stanley's response was overly aggressive at high speeds,

179
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,835
and so a damping term on heading rate was also added.

180
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:19,255
This essentially converts the heading error control portion to a PD controller,

181
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:25,015
and the same idea can be applied to the pure pursuit control of curvature as well.

182
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:28,585
Finally, for curved paths with high curvature,

183
00:11:28,585 --> 00:11:32,390
the controller fails to track them well as the reference dynamics

184
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,500
were not considered in the derivation of the geometric controllers.

185
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,330
It is also possible as we saw in longitudinal control to enhance

186
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,790
the performance and drive errors to 0 more

187
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,720
quickly by adding a feed forward term to the controller.

188
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,770
In this case, it is sufficient to simply include the steering angle

189
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,045
required to maintain the curvature of the desired path.

190
00:11:56,045 --> 00:12:01,190
With these modifications, the Stanley controller becomes a useful tool for

191
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:06,740
moderate driving tasks as long as the vehicle avoids exiting the linear tire region.

192
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,500
We'll look more at defining paths that are safe to

193
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,845
track in the fourth course of this specialization.

194
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:16,190
In this lesson, you learned how to apply

195
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,330
the Stanley controller as a geometric path tracking controller,

196
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:25,370
what the convergence properties are for the Stanley controller and how

197
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,485
to add further enhancements that improve the controllers real-world performance.

198
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:32,030
In the next video,

199
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,090
we'll introduce the model predictive control method and

200
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,690
advanced model-based control method that can overcome many of

201
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,410
the limitations of geometric controllers. See you next time.
