00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,295
Welcome back. In the last lesson,

2
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:21,825
we defined important concepts relevant for the lateral vehicle control.

3
00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:25,575
In this lesson, we will put these concepts to good use.

4
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:27,720
We'll first introduce the concept of

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,300
a geometric path tracking controller which

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,940
relies on our kinematic vehicle model for selecting

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,015
steering commands and then we'll design

8
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,620
a pure pursuit controller for

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,730
our self-driving cars to track a reference path through the environment.

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,255
Let's get started. So what is a geometric path tracking controller?

11
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:51,425
Generically, it is any controller that tracks a reference path

12
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:56,210
using only the geometry of the vehicle kinematics and the reference path.

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,240
In the case of self-driving cars,

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,900
a geometric path tracking controller is a type of lateral controller that

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,490
ignores dynamic forces on the vehicles

16
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,690
and assumes the no-slip condition holds at the wheels.

17
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,130
It relies on a kinematic bicycle model and the error measures defined in

18
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,460
the previous video to construct a steering command rule that achieves path tracking.

19
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,425
Because of its simple nature,

20
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:24,515
it is very popular and useful in robotics and autonomous driving.

21
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:27,850
However, this simple approach has a downside in that

22
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,840
its performance suffers when the vehicle motion does not match the no-slip assumption,

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,735
as is the case in aggressive vehicle maneuvers with high lateral acceleration.

24
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:40,900
In these cases, a deeper understanding of

25
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,600
the limits of the available tire forces is needed,

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,020
as are more involved control strategies.

27
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,150
When the vehicle is operating in the linear tire region and a tire is not saturated,

28
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,560
however, geometric path tracking controllers can work very well.

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,150
Geometric path tracking controllers rely on a reference point along the desired path,

30
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,820
which can be the same reference point used to compute heading and cross track errors,

31
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:12,260
or it can be a look-ahead point some distance in front of the vehicle along the path,

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,760
an example of which is shown in red here.

33
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,250
In fact, the pure pursuit controller we're about to

34
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,820
derive uses a look-ahead point on the reference path,

35
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,940
while the Stanley controller in the next video uses

36
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,720
the same reference point as is needed for error calculations.

37
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,010
Let's now take a closer look at the pure pursuit controller.

38
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,900
In the pure pursuit method,

39
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,780
the core idea is that a reference point can be

40
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,065
placed on the path a fixed distance ahead of the vehicle,

41
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:45,080
and the steering commands needed to intersect with

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,235
this point using a constant steering angle can be computed.

43
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:53,870
As the vehicle turns towards the path to follow this curve,

44
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,030
the point continues to move forward,

45
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,965
reducing the steering angle and gently bringing the vehicle towards the path.

46
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:03,260
In this method, the center of

47
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,800
the rear axle is used as the reference point on the vehicle,

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,730
and we define the line that connects the center of the rear axle

49
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,304
to the target reference point as a line of fixed distance ld,

50
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:17,405
known as the look-ahead distance,

51
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,645
which is the red dashed line in this figure.

52
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:23,650
The angle between the vehicle's body heading

53
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,975
and the look-ahead line is referred to as alpha.

54
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:30,185
To construct the pure pursuit controller,

55
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:34,975
we once again turn to the concept of the instantaneous center of rotation.

56
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:37,274
The target point on the trajectory,

57
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:39,175
the center of the rear axle,

58
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:42,275
and the instantaneous center of rotation form

59
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:47,230
a triangle with two sides of length R and one of length ld.

60
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,730
We'd like to define the arc that takes

61
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,090
the vehicle reference point to the target point on the path.

62
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:59,180
This arc is the part of the ICR circle that covers the angle of two alpha.

63
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,890
The angle two alpha can be derived using standard trigonometric identities.

64
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,915
Based on the law of sines,

65
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:10,010
we can write the following equation: ld over the sine of

66
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:16,025
two alpha is equal to r over the sine of pi over two minus alpha.

67
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:19,310
Then using some more trigonometric identities,

68
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,530
we can simplify the equations as follows,

69
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:30,765
which leads to the compact expression ld over sine alpha is equal to two R. Finally,

70
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:35,990
the curvature kappa, which is the inverse of the arc radius R,

71
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,670
is equal to two sine alpha over ld.

72
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,770
Now, let's take a look at the bicycle model to calculate

73
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,995
the steering angle needed to track this arc.

74
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:49,895
Recall that the steering angle defines the arc radius

75
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:54,215
and yields the relation tan delta is equal to the car length l,

76
00:04:54,215 --> 00:04:57,260
over the arc radius R. Combining

77
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,560
this expression with the expression for R derived earlier,

78
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,710
we can now express the steering angle needed to follow

79
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,235
the arc in terms of easily computed values.

80
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:14,280
The steering angle delta is set to the inverse tan of 2L sine alpha over ld.

81
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,530
This is an easily implemented controller for steering,

82
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,520
but how well will it perform?

83
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,345
To understand this, we need to dig into how the error values evolve in closed loop.

84
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:29,060
For the pure pursuit controller,

85
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,610
we can define the cross track error as

86
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,205
the distance between the heading vector and the target point.

87
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:39,425
Once again, we'll use e to denote the cross track error.

88
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:45,155
We now arrive at the expression sine alpha equals e over ld.

89
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:48,335
Combining this with the expression for curvature

90
00:05:48,335 --> 00:05:51,380
shows us that the curvature of the path created by

91
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,320
the pure pursuit controller is proportional

92
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,985
to the cross track error at the look-ahead reference point.

93
00:05:57,985 --> 00:06:00,030
As the error increases,

94
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,560
so does the curvature,

95
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,020
bringing the vehicle back to the path more aggressively.

96
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,430
This equation demonstrates that the pure pursuit controller works in a manner similar to

97
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,740
proportional control to correct

98
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,945
cross track error using path curvature as the output of the controller.

99
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:22,895
The proportional gain depends on two over ld squared.

100
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:25,505
So as the look-ahead distance increases,

101
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:29,195
the proportional gain decreases in a nonlinear manner.

102
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:33,590
It's important to note that the pure pursuit controller with a fixed value of

103
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:39,430
ld leads to a curvature controller that does not take into account the vehicle speed.

104
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,910
This means that the selected steering angle would be the same regardless of

105
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,770
whether the vehicle is going 10 kilometers per hour or 100 kilometers per hour,

106
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,830
leading to very different lateral acceleration's.

107
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,300
A controller tuned for high-speed would be far too sluggish at low speed,

108
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,085
and one tuned for low speed would be dangerously aggressive at high speeds.

109
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:03,200
To overcome this limitation,

110
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,210
we add one more modification to our pure pursuit controller.

111
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:12,575
We can vary the look-ahead distance ld based on the speed of the vehicle.

112
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:18,445
We define the look-ahead distance to increase proportional to the vehicle forward speed.

113
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:24,920
The addition to the controller takes the form ld is equal to K sub PP,

114
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,005
the pure pursuit look-ahead gain,

115
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:29,945
times the forward velocity, vf.

116
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:34,685
Substituting this adjustment into the steering angle command equation,

117
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:38,105
we arrive at the complete pure pursuit controller.

118
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:40,700
The controller selects the steering angle that

119
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,525
will form an arc to the look-ahead reference point,

120
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:48,830
and adjusts this look-ahead point to be further away the faster the vehicle is traveling.

121
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,800
This design results in steering commands and turn

122
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,160
rates that are achievable given available tire forces,

123
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,485
although it must be tuned to do so.

124
00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:59,990
You now are ready to start building

125
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,270
geometric lateral controllers for self-driving cars. Let's summarize.

126
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,030
In this lesson, we defined the class of

127
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,620
geometric path tracking controllers and derived the pure proceed controller,

128
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,540
which is one of two geometric path following controllers that we'll study in this course.

129
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,950
In the next video, we'll explore the second geometric path tracking controller,

130
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,150
the Stanley controller. We'll see you there.
