00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,885
Welcome back.

2
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:17,210
In the last video,

3
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,300
we studied the Stanley controller

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,535
for lateral path tracking control.

5
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:23,785
In this video, we will explore

6
00:00:23,785 --> 00:00:26,224
an advanced applied control strategy,

7
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:29,490
known as Model Predictive
Control or MPC,

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,480
to understand how to incorporate

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,405
dynamic modeling into
controller design.

10
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:36,490
Specifically in this video,

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,895
we will describe the MPC architecture

12
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:42,855
and the concept of
receding horizon control,

13
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:45,955
formulate an MPC optimization problem

14
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:48,635
for both linear and nonlinear models,

15
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:53,590
and apply MPC to joint longitudinal
and lateral vehicle control.

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,440
Let's dive in. First, let's

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,200
quickly go through the key aspects
of Model Predictive Control.

18
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,060
MPC refers to the control
design approach that

19
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,930
numerically solves an optimization
problem at each time-step.

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,270
Because solving an
optimization problem

21
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,475
at each time step can take time,

22
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:15,160
MPC was originally applied to slow

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,275
processes such as
industrial chemical processing.

24
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:21,070
However, the ever-improving
performance of

25
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,140
today's computing hardware has made

26
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,960
MPC a viable approach even
on embedded hardware.

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,570
More and more automotive
applications are

28
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,300
turning to MPC as a way to improve

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,940
performance and expand
operating range

30
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,685
for a suite of different
embedded controllers,

31
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:41,030
from traction control
and stability control,

32
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,970
to emission reduction,
and idle speed control.

33
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,330
Longitudinal and lateral control
for autonomous vehicles is

34
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,960
another extremely suitable
application for MPC.

35
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,465
Model Predictive Control is often

36
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:57,410
interchangeably referred to
as Receding Horizon Control,

37
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,430
since the controller generates
an actuator signal based on

38
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,620
a fixed finite length horizon at

39
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,200
each time-step which receives
as time moves forward.

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,350
The key advantages to solving

41
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,899
online optimizations as part of
the controller are as follows:

42
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:16,490
The formulation of
an MPC controller is

43
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,160
straightforward requiring
the definition of

44
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,995
an objective function
and relevant constraints

45
00:02:21,995 --> 00:02:25,610
that are then optimized using
well-established solvers.

46
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,900
The states and control signals
can be constrained to stay within

47
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,870
safe operating bounds
and controls can be

48
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,770
selected to maximize
multiple objectives simultaneously.

49
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,485
Both hard constraints and
soft penalties can be employed,

50
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:42,844
leading to a rich set of solutions

51
00:02:42,844 --> 00:02:45,230
for constrained control problems.

52
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,510
As many automotive subsystems have

53
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,680
rigid actuator constraints and
diverse performance objectives,

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,135
MPC has emerged as a major tool
for vehicle control.

55
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:59,090
The controller can be
explicitly applied to

56
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,930
the linear or non-linear models of
the vehicle and its subsystems,

57
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,480
meaning that we can
use the same approach

58
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,990
even as our models change
or improve over time.

59
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,415
The trade-off these advantages
must be weighed against,

60
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:14,120
is that MPC requires

61
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,790
significantly more
computational resources

62
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,660
than a Static Control Law.

63
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,855
It is certainly possible to create

64
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:23,180
optimization formulations
that are too

65
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,040
expensive to compute at

66
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,655
the high update rates required
for smooth vehicle control.

67
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:33,860
Careful implementation is needed
to avoid overloading processors.

68
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,055
Before we start designing
MPC controllers,

69
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:41,725
let's take a closer look at
the concept of Receding Horizon.

70
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:44,445
Receding Horizon Control solves

71
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:47,869
a fixed size optimization
at each time-step,

72
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:50,570
which identifies
optimal control inputs

73
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,910
to apply from the current time to

74
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,100
the end of the horizon based on

75
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,565
the objectives constraints and
current state of the vehicle.

76
00:03:58,565 --> 00:04:02,270
One issue that arises in
implementation however,

77
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,630
is that because optimization
can take some amount of time,

78
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,765
the state of the vehicle when
starting the optimization,

79
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:10,370
will be different from the state of

80
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,070
the vehicle when completing
the optimization.

81
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,580
As a results, we must
use a predicted state in

82
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,920
the optimization for
the time at which

83
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,100
the control input will
actually be applied.

84
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,875
Let's step through the process
and clarify the notation needed.

85
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:32,205
First, we define the receding
horizon length t. Then,

86
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,710
we set the initial state for

87
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,770
the optimization to be
the predicted state at the end of

88
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,495
the optimization x at time t. Next,

89
00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:43,790
we solve the optimization
as the vehicle

90
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,400
moves from its current
state at time t minus

91
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,160
one to x of t using

92
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,840
the control input identified
in the previous optimization.

93
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,950
Although we won't exactly arrive at

94
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,355
the predicted state at
time t due to disturbances,

95
00:04:58,355 --> 00:05:03,460
we do expect to be reasonably close
if the time interval is short.

96
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,060
Finally, we apply the control
signal from the first time step of

97
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,295
the receding horizon optimization

98
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:13,570
and repeat the process
for the next time step.

99
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,415
We can visualize the Receding
Horizon or MPC Algorithm,

100
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:21,545
using the following block
diagram for a control.

101
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:25,220
We have two main blocks,
an optimizer block,

102
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,320
which is the core MPC component

103
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,375
or a Receding Horizon
Control component,

104
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,310
and the dynamic model.

105
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,640
The model takes in
the past inputs and state

106
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,955
from time t minus one and takes in

107
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:40,310
the output of the optimizer which is

108
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,035
the current sequence of inputs U
at each time step in the horizon.

109
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:49,730
The model then outputs predicted
states at the next time-step,

110
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,580
which are compared to
the reference trajectory and

111
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,930
passed into the optimizer as
the future or predicted error.

112
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,585
The optimizer also receives

113
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:03,260
updated constraints and
the cost function to use,

114
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,910
which can be fixed in advanced or

115
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,940
varied based on changing
operating modes.

116
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,920
The optimizer then solves

117
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,260
its optimization and
the process repeats.

118
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,345
Now, let's take a look at
the linear MPC design in particular.

119
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:20,570
We use the state space
formulation which

120
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,930
represents a motion
model in discrete form.

121
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,810
The future states
are linearly related

122
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,495
to the current states and
the actuator signals.

123
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:31,280
Note that, A and B are

124
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,030
the coefficient matrices and are
assumed to be time-invariant.

125
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,160
MPC seeks to find

126
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,630
a control policy U of inputs
over a finite horizon.

127
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,539
If all the states are
to be driven to zero,

128
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:48,215
the objective function or cost
function when we minimize,

129
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:51,710
can be defined as follows:
with quadratic error on

130
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,540
both deviations of the state from

131
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,320
zero and on non-zero control inputs.

132
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,575
This is similar to
the optimization problem of

133
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:03,305
optimal control theory and trades off

134
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:06,710
control performance and
input aggressiveness.

135
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,040
Note that, the matrices Q
and R are called weight

136
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,350
matrices and can be selected to

137
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,275
achieve a particular
type of response.

138
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:17,405
If instead we need to track

139
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:20,515
a reference signals such
as a desired trajectory,

140
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:23,210
we modify the formulation to include

141
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,260
the error delta x relative
to the desired state.

142
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,560
This is a famous
optimization formulation

143
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,674
and has a closed form solution,

144
00:07:32,674 --> 00:07:36,020
the Linear Quadratic
Regulator or LQR.

145
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,620
The closed form solution
uses full state feedback,

146
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,025
meaning that all states are
used in the control response.

147
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:47,455
The LQR solution defines
a control gain matrix K,

148
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,420
which can be computed from
the A and B matrices of

149
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,280
the state-space model and

150
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,905
the Q and R matrices
of the cost function.

151
00:07:54,905 --> 00:07:57,950
We've included links in
the supplemental materials to

152
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,280
this fascinating result of
states-pace control theory.

153
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,410
In the more general case,

154
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,835
the objective function is

155
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:07,490
any differentiable
non-linear function of

156
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,820
a state and inputs over
the receding horizon.

157
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,749
The constraints imposed on
the optimization can include;

158
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:17,165
non-linear dynamic models of motion,

159
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,130
state and input bounds that

160
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,920
capture things like
maximum steering angles,

161
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,800
and any other inequality
constraints g

162
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,160
are equality constraints
h that affect our system.

163
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,205
For such a general
optimization problem however,

164
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:33,985
no closed form solution exists.

165
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:38,775
So, we must rely on numerical
optimization to find a solution.

166
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:42,590
Even the kinematic bicycle
model falls into this category.

167
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,079
So, almost all MPC controllers

168
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,365
for autonomous driving will
be solved numerically.

169
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:50,960
Let's now look at
the implementation of

170
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,460
an MPC controller for trajectory
tracking on a self-driving car.

171
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,325
MPC will be used in the same feedback
structure presented earlier,

172
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:02,510
but we include the conversion from

173
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,490
the tire forces to throttle, break,

174
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,320
and steering commands as a low
level controller inside the loop.

175
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,490
The inputs to the MPC block
or the reference trajectory,

176
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,615
which include the reference
path and velocity,

177
00:09:16,615 --> 00:09:19,895
as well as the vehicle states
at each time step.

178
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:22,560
The outputs of the MPC block are

179
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,774
the lateral and longitudinal forces

180
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:27,370
needed to follow
the desired trajectory.

181
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,180
These forces are then translated
into throttle, breaking,

182
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,140
and steering commands, as the output
of the low-level control.

183
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,780
Finally, the actuation signals

184
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,460
are applied to the vehicle
at each time-step,

185
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,590
and a new vehicle state is achieved
closing the feedback loop.

186
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,530
The MPC optimization
will be set up as

187
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,795
follows to perform
a double lane change maneuver.

188
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:55,164
First, we define a cost for
tracking the desired trajectory,

189
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:57,130
which includes deviation from

190
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,810
the desired trajectory and

191
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,885
minimization of control
command magnitude.

192
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:05,510
Next, we define motion
constraints on the vehicle,

193
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,090
which rely on the lateral
and longitudinal models

194
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,070
developed in earlier videos.

195
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,770
We also impose maximum limits

196
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,840
on the tire forces
to restrict them to

197
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,330
fall within the linear tire region to

198
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,645
avoid extreme responses
to control our errors.

199
00:10:20,645 --> 00:10:23,570
These costs and constraints define

200
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,000
the optimization used in our example,

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,755
which then gets converted into

202
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:31,685
actual vehicle commands by
the low-level controller.

203
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:34,339
It is also possible to incorporate

204
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:37,715
the low-level control into
the MPC optimization,

205
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:41,720
which would involve including
as constraints, the engine map,

206
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,075
full vehicle dynamic models,

207
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:47,345
actuator forces, and
tire force models.

208
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:49,985
The result is a large
optimization problem

209
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:52,640
that may be challenging
to solve in real time,

210
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,115
but let's have a look at the results.

211
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:59,540
This simulation is done for
the double lane change scenario,

212
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,960
where the vehicle first accelerates
to a steady-state speed of

213
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,725
17 meters per second or
60 kilometers per hour,

214
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:09,830
then maneuvers
four meters to the left,

215
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,145
and returns four meters to
the right immediately thereafter.

216
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:15,830
The following plots
show the results of

217
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,754
the simulated maneuver
with MPC control,

218
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:20,750
with the reference trajectory in

219
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,905
blue and the actual
vehicle trajectory in red.

220
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:27,680
We can see that
the tracking performance with

221
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,004
the MPC controller is excellent,

222
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:33,920
lagging slightly, but without
overshoot or oscillation.

223
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,115
This is perhaps not
surprising as the simulation

224
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:41,045
and MPC use the same
model and parameters.

225
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:43,780
The output of model
predictive controllers,

226
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,340
the lateral and longitudinal forces,

227
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,985
can be seen to be smoothly
varying and well-behaved.

228
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:52,610
Also, the vehicle yaw rate during

229
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,310
the double lane change
maneuver is plotted,

230
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,910
revealing precise tracking
throughout the states of a vehicle.

231
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,280
MPC shows a lot of promises

232
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,120
a control technique for
autonomous driving and can be

233
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,910
used without modification
for a wide range of

234
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,510
operating conditions and
a large variety of scenarios.

235
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,990
This flexibility and
convenience comes at the cost

236
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,500
of increased computational
requirements and relies

237
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,815
on the availability of
robust optimization solvers to

238
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:25,850
always return feasible solutions
in the available time window.

239
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,210
Let's summarize what we've
discussed in this video.

240
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:33,620
We first explored the definition
of Model Predictive Control and

241
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,260
the Receding Horizon and constructed

242
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,265
the closed loop block diagram
for an MPC system.

243
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:45,430
We then define the costs and
constraints used in MPC.

244
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,020
Finally, we applied MPC to

245
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,380
the trajectory tracking problem
for self-driving cars.

246
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,995
Congratulations, you've made
it to the end of the module.

247
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:57,050
In this module, you learned how to

248
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,980
define the lateral
path tracking problem,

249
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,475
applied two geometric path
tracking controllers,

250
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:04,670
the pure pursuit and

251
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,625
Stanley controllers to
the path tracking problem,

252
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:11,090
and defined a Model Predictive
Controller for joint,

253
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,655
lateral, and longitudinal control.

254
00:13:13,655 --> 00:13:16,520
In the final module in this course,

255
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,485
you'll get your first hands on look

256
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:20,480
at the Carlos simulator where you'll

257
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,790
design lateral and
longitudinal controllers

258
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,220
to navigate a vehicle
around a race track.
