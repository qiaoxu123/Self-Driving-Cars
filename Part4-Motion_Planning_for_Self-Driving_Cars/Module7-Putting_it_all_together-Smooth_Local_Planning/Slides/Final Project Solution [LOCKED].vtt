1
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.490
Hi everyone. I'd like
to congratulate you on

2
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.280
completing the course
for final project.

3
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.230
It combined many of the concepts

4
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.000
we covered throughout the course,

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.370
and the other courses
in this specialization.

6
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.470
So you should be proud
of your efforts to

7
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.245
accomplish this
challenging final task.

8
00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:33.395
In this video we
will be discussing

9
00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:35.360
our solution to
the final project,

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.010
which you can use to compare

11
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.050
your code to in order
to help you with

12
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.550
sections of the project
you struggled

13
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.355
with or we're unsure if
your answer was correct.

14
00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:45.920
In particular for
our solution there were

15
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.170
four main tasks to
complete in order to

16
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.670
enable all of the functionality

17
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.285
required for our three-stage
scenario and Carla.

18
00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:55.615
These were past generation,

19
00:00:55.615 --> 00:00:57.240
path collision checking,

20
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.935
velocity profile generation,
and behavior planning.

21
00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:03.620
Let's take a look at
each of these steps.

22
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.265
The first task you had to
complete was path generation.

23
00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:09.680
For this assignment, we
had given you all of

24
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.880
the required code to optimize
a spiral to a given point.

25
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.430
So all you needed to
add was to extract

26
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.840
the goal points from the way

27
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.730
points sequence you were given.

28
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.845
We did this by iterating
through the way points

29
00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:25.700
and finding the closest
one to the ego vehicle,

30
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.320
and then progressing through way

31
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.450
points until we
arrived at a way point

32
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.370
that was at least a look
ahead distance away from us.

33
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.050
The look ahead distance
represents how far ahead of

34
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.020
the vehicle we are
planning during any cycle.

35
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.675
Once this goal point is selected,

36
00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:44.630
we laterally offset
additional goal points from

37
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.380
the selected way point to
generate a goal state set.

38
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.940
We do this to give the car

39
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.250
multiple options to select from,

40
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.845
which will allow it
to avoid obstacles.

41
00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:58.115
The lateral spacing
is 90 degrees rotated

42
00:01:58.115 --> 00:01:59.210
away from the heading of

43
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.375
the road at the target way point.

44
00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:03.380
This ensures that
our planned path

45
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.005
set conforms to
the structure of the road.

46
00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:09.050
We then have to rotate and
translate these points

47
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.960
from the global frame to
the ego vehicles frame,

48
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.610
such that the ego vehicle is at

49
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.880
the origin with zero heading.

50
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.760
Once this is done, we can

51
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.850
pass these goal points
to the spiral

52
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.490
optimizer which will
then compute the path

53
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.165
that we can use in
our future planning steps.

54
00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:28.460
Once we have our path set,

55
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.140
the next step to perform is

56
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.540
collision checking
and path selection.

57
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.780
To compute the best feasible
and collision-free path

58
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.955
for our ego vehicle to follow.

59
00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:41.090
The way we performed
collision checking was to use

60
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.360
the circle based method we
introduced in Module Four.

61
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.420
In particular, we overlaid
circles on top of

62
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.380
the vehicle location at
each point along the path.

63
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.850
This generates a set of
circles which gives us

64
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.780
a conservative approximation
of the ego vehicle swath.

65
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.900
We then checked if each of
the obstacle points was

66
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.125
located within any of
the circles along the path.

67
00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:06.050
If any of the points did
fall within the circles,

68
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.915
then this path was labeled
as having a collision.

69
00:03:08.915 --> 00:03:11.015
We then repeated this process for

70
00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:12.770
each of the paths removing all

71
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.150
of those that collided with

72
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.825
obstacles from future
consideration.

73
00:03:16.825 --> 00:03:19.320
Once our collision check
was complete,

74
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.875
we then selected
the collision-free path

75
00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:23.840
whose end-point was closest to

76
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.040
the line center line
as our best path.

77
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.100
We select this because
it allows us to track

78
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.560
the global way points
along the center of

79
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.810
the lane even if
we had to veer off

80
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.765
course temporarily due to
an obstacle along our path.

81
00:03:37.765 --> 00:03:40.000
This choice does lead us to cut

82
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.175
as close as possible
to obstacles.

83
00:03:42.175 --> 00:03:44.125
So we had to be careful to ensure

84
00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:47.530
our collision checks were
conservative with some buffer.

85
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.200
Once we have a suitable
path selected,

86
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.050
we need to generate
a velocity profile for it.

87
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.210
We are given a reference velocity

88
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.910
depending on the behavior
we are trying to execute.

89
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.325
If we are decelerating to
a stop or staying stopped,

90
00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:03.555
our target velocity
should be zero.

91
00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:05.760
Otherwise, it should
be the speed limit.

92
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.420
However, we need to take

93
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.505
leading vehicles
into consideration.

94
00:04:09.505 --> 00:04:11.240
Because if a leading vehicle is

95
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.670
moving more slowly
than us we may hit it.

96
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.290
To handle this, we set

97
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.940
our target velocity to be

98
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.100
the minimum of
the reference velocity,

99
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.395
and the lead vehicle speed.

100
00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:23.480
We also need to make sure that

101
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.190
we reach the lead vehicle speed

102
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.820
by the time we reach the
lead vehicles original location.

103
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.980
Otherwise we risk a collision.

104
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.635
From this information,
we can now construct

105
00:04:33.635 --> 00:04:36.560
a ramp trajectory from
our current velocity,

106
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.020
to the target velocity
along our path.

107
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.685
If there is a lead vehicle,

108
00:04:40.685 --> 00:04:43.040
the end-point of
the ramp profile will be

109
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.430
the lead vehicles position
less a time gap buffer.

110
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.990
Otherwise the end-point of

111
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.635
the ramp profile will
be the end of the path.

112
00:04:50.635 --> 00:04:52.790
Finally, we must implement

113
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.460
the behavioral planner
for our ego vehicle.

114
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.770
The only regulatory
element we will

115
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.095
face in this project
is a stop sign,

116
00:05:00.095 --> 00:05:03.200
so that will be the focus
of the behavioral planner.

117
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.660
To handle it,
our behavioral planner

118
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.235
will have three states.

119
00:05:07.235 --> 00:05:09.620
A nominal lane following state,

120
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.870
a decelerate to stop state,

121
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.805
and a stay stop state.

122
00:05:13.805 --> 00:05:16.010
During the course of
normal driving we will

123
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.655
stay in the lane following state.

124
00:05:18.655 --> 00:05:21.260
Once the endpoint
of our planned path

125
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.720
crosses the stop
line of a stop sign,

126
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.049
we then switch from driving
normally to decelerating

127
00:05:27.049 --> 00:05:30.470
to a stop at the stop point
defined by that stopline.

128
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.630
To do this, we must transition to

129
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.700
the decelerate to stop state,

130
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.590
and ensure our planned length

131
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.695
provides sufficient time
to decelerate comfortably.

132
00:05:39.695 --> 00:05:42.080
Once we've stopped we transition

133
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.000
to the stay stopped state to make

134
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.010
sure the car is at
a complete stop at

135
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.560
the stop sign for
a fixed period of time.

136
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.560
In this case, we
choose two seconds.

137
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.970
Once that is done,

138
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.090
we then transition back to
the lane following state,

139
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.400
and continue with
nominal driving.

140
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.760
This completes the state
machine transition cycle,

141
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.590
and allows us to
handle the presence of

142
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.320
a stop sign along our path.

143
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.500
Once we've completed
each of these steps,

144
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.290
we now have a fully
functional motion planner,

145
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.545
that can handle the scenario
presented in this project.

146
00:06:15.545 --> 00:06:19.130
If you struggled with
any portion of this project,

147
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.830
try implementing
that portion as discussed in

148
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.385
this video to see if you can
improve its performance.

149
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.920
Of course, there are
multiple approaches

150
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.830
defined in the course for
many aspects of this project.

151
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.450
There is no restriction on

152
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.580
which approach you choose to use.

153
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.440
If you found
an alternative method

154
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.460
that worked really well,

155
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.470
be sure to let us
know in the forums.

156
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.570
Now that you've completed
the course project,

157
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.430
you should have
a strong grasp for

158
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.810
the motion planning concepts

159
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.370
we've covered in course four.

160
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.080
In the final two videos,

161
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.485
we'll close out both this course
