00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.445
Hi everyone. In this lesson,

2
00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:19.050
we will discuss how to

3
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.170
incorporate some of the
objectives and constraints we

4
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.240
discussed in module one with

5
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.550
the cubic spirals in
boundary conditions we

6
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.620
introduced in the last lesson to

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.755
create a path planning
optimization problem.

8
00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:33.375
By solving this problem,

9
00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.185
we'll be able to generate smooth,

10
00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:38.915
feasible paths that satisfy
all of our constraints.

11
00:00:38.915 --> 00:00:40.460
By the end of this video,

12
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.950
you should be able to:

13
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.270
Identify the boundary
conditions and

14
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.770
constraints required for

15
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.010
smooth path planning
using polynomial spirals,

16
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.010
approximate some of
the required constraints to

17
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.100
improve the tractability of
the optimization problem,

18
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.000
and know how to map the required
parameters in such a way

19
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.440
that the optimization problem

20
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.125
converges quickly to
a feasible solution.

21
00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:05.690
Let's get started. If you

22
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.430
recall from the previous lesson,

23
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.170
our boundary conditions described

24
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.420
the absolute minimum
requirements for

25
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.320
a path being planned
between two points.

26
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.630
Essentially, they
require that for

27
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.389
a given starting position
heading and curvature,

28
00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:21.310
our planned path ends at

29
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.520
a specific position heading
and curvature as well.

30
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.280
This will give us our first set
of constraints on

31
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.170
our optimization problem known as

32
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.215
boundary conditions
which we can see here.

33
00:01:32.215 --> 00:01:34.690
Unfortunately, as we discussed in

34
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.940
the last lesson that cubic spiral

35
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.279
does not have
a closed form solution

36
00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:41.540
for the position at
the end of the spiral.

37
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.450
To write our constraints in terms

38
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.220
of the parameters of the spiral,

39
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.685
we will need to use a numerical
integration technique.

40
00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:50.680
Many exist, but we'll apply

41
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.120
Simpson's rule which we

42
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.190
briefly mentioned in
the previous lesson.

43
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.295
Let's look a bit more
closely at Simpson's rule.

44
00:01:57.295 --> 00:01:59.060
Simpson's rule is

45
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.910
a commonly used numerical
integration technique

46
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.845
that is generally
more precise than

47
00:02:03.845 --> 00:02:06.005
other simpler numerical methods.

48
00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:08.780
This is because it
evaluates the integral of

49
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.675
the quadratic interpolation
of the given function

50
00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:13.220
rather than the integral of

51
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.810
the linear interpolation as in

52
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.590
some methods such as
midpoint and trapezoidal rules.

53
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.965
Simpson's rule proceeds
by defining a number of

54
00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:23.600
equally spaced divisions of

55
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.365
the integration domain
defined by n,

56
00:02:26.365 --> 00:02:28.295
and then summing terms at

57
00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:30.260
each division and boundary point.

58
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.415
For example, if we
choose n equal to four,

59
00:02:33.415 --> 00:02:35.615
then we are splitting
the integration domain

60
00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:37.955
into four equally sized segments,

61
00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:41.600
and we therefore have five
points to include in our sum.

62
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.230
Each term in the sum is
the function evaluated at

63
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.970
the division point multiplied

64
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.755
by the appropriate coefficient.

65
00:02:48.755 --> 00:02:51.530
In the interior of
the Simpson's rule equation,

66
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.745
we can see that we have

67
00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:55.550
alternating coefficients
of four and two for

68
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.320
each term except for

69
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.975
the endpoint terms which
have a coefficient of one.

70
00:02:59.975 --> 00:03:01.535
As one would expect,

71
00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:03.440
as n increases, we get

72
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.365
a more accurate approximation
to our integral.

73
00:03:06.365 --> 00:03:09.710
Let's apply this to
our specific planning problem.

74
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.645
If we take n equals eight

75
00:03:11.645 --> 00:03:13.400
in the Simpson's rule
approximation,

76
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.930
our approximation will be

77
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.730
accurate enough for
the optimizations

78
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.350
we'll be performing without

79
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.755
being too computationally
expensive.

80
00:03:20.755 --> 00:03:23.240
Since the heading
Theta is just the

81
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.520
integral of the cubic
spiral function,

82
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.790
we can explicitly define
a closed form solution

83
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.960
for it which is

84
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.975
a fourth order polynomial
which is shown here.

85
00:03:32.975 --> 00:03:35.420
We can then use the values of

86
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.820
Theta at each division point in

87
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.040
a Simpson's rule approximation to

88
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.615
compute the x and y positions
of the cubic spiral.

89
00:03:43.615 --> 00:03:47.210
The integrands to be
integrated for x and y are

90
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.725
cosine of Theta of s and sine
of theta of s respectively,

91
00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:53.930
which are substituted in for f in

92
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.385
the Simpson's rule to form
the following expressions.

93
00:03:57.385 --> 00:04:00.020
We now have a useful
approximation to

94
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.670
the X and Y position of

95
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.090
the spiral at any given arc
length point defined by

96
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.790
our arc length
parameter s. We will

97
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.640
denote the approximations
to x and y as

98
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.830
computed using Simpson's
rule as x sub s and

99
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.410
y sub s. Returning to
our boundary conditions,

100
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.140
we now have an approximation
for the path ending location

101
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.120
and we can write out
the boundary conditions in

102
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.670
terms of the known
parameters of the spiral.

103
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.920
We can now generate a spiral from

104
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.230
one point to another
that satisfies

105
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.469
the given boundary conditions
by iteratively optimizing

106
00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.540
the parameters of the spiral as

107
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.290
well as its total arc length Sf.

108
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.165
Before we do that, however,

109
00:04:40.165 --> 00:04:42.050
let's go over
the kinematic constraints

110
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.595
we would like to enforce.

111
00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:46.970
Specifically for autonomous
driving path planning,

112
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.390
we're going to be focusing
on curvature constraints.

113
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.000
Cars have an absolute
minimum turning radius

114
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.485
and need to stay within

115
00:04:54.485 --> 00:04:56.510
lateral acceleration limits to

116
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.420
maintain wheel traction and
ride comfort in the vehicle.

117
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.550
We'll discuss these constraints

118
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.740
in more detail in future lessons.

119
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.110
For now, let's assume
that our car can

120
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.975
achieve a minimum turning
radius of two meters.

121
00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.885
This corresponds to
a maximum curvature

122
00:05:11.885 --> 00:05:14.680
of 0.5 arc meters.

123
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.120
Now, it's quite
difficult to write out

124
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.650
this curvature constraint at

125
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.825
every single point
along the spiral.

126
00:05:20.825 --> 00:05:24.110
However, because of the
polynomial nature of the spiral,

127
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.505
we only have to constrain
a few evenly spaced points.

128
00:05:27.505 --> 00:05:29.570
Because the polynomial
function of

129
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.105
curvature is continuous
and well-behaved,

130
00:05:32.105 --> 00:05:34.970
we're likely to generate
a spiral that satisfies

131
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.290
our curvature requirements when

132
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.420
performing the optimization.

133
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.930
For simplicity, let's
constrain the curvature

134
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.395
at the one-third and two-third
points of the curve.

135
00:05:45.395 --> 00:05:47.750
The start and end
point curvatures were

136
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.545
already constrained in
the boundary conditions.

137
00:05:50.545 --> 00:05:53.015
Once we've done this, we now have

138
00:05:53.015 --> 00:05:54.500
our curvature constraints as

139
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.170
a function of the
parameters of the spiral,

140
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.640
and we have all of

141
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.080
our required constraints to

142
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.545
solve the optimization problem.

143
00:06:02.545 --> 00:06:04.850
The final piece of the puzzle is

144
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.060
the actual objective function
we wish to minimize.

145
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.070
We want to encourage smoothness

146
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.990
and comfort along
our planned path.

147
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.660
One way to do so is to distribute

148
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.900
the absolute curvature
evenly along the path.

149
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.090
This can be done by minimizing

150
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.420
the bending energy of
our planned parametric curve.

151
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.540
The bending energy of
a curve is the integral of

152
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.730
its squared curvature along

153
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.370
the entire arc length
of the path.

154
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.650
Since we have
a polynomial function of

155
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.154
curvature describing
our cubic spiral,

156
00:06:36.154 --> 00:06:37.970
the bending energy integral has

157
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.680
a closed form solution in

158
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.885
terms of the spiral's parameters.

159
00:06:41.885 --> 00:06:44.045
In addition, its gradient

160
00:06:44.045 --> 00:06:46.130
also has a closed form solution.

161
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.370
Both of these expressions
have many terms however so

162
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.985
it's best left to a symbolic
solver to create them.

163
00:06:52.985 --> 00:06:55.370
The fact that
the objective function and

164
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.400
its gradient have closed
form solutions make it an

165
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.590
objective function that
is highly conducive to

166
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.450
nonlinear programming which we

167
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.520
will discuss in our next lesson.

168
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.800
Now that we have
our objective function,

169
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.050
we can put everything
together into our path

170
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.765
planning optimization
problems shown here.

171
00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.760
For our purposes, we're going to

172
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.535
assume the initial boundary
conditions are zero,

173
00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:18.395
which means that we are defining

174
00:07:18.395 --> 00:07:20.000
our local planning problem in

175
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.160
the vehicle frame and results in

176
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.845
the simplified expressions
for the heading and

177
00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:26.720
x and y approximations using

178
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.285
Simpson's rule we've
defined in this video.

179
00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:30.980
This means that the initial

180
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.660
boundary value constraints can be

181
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.400
removed since they are already

182
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.490
accounted for in
our integral calculations.

183
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.160
Now we could very well
stop here and use

184
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.980
this as our path generating
optimization problem.

185
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.620
However, there is
a practical issue with how

186
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.470
this optimization problem
is set up that may slow it

187
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.140
down or cause it not to
converge at all when

188
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.305
solved using canonical
non-linear programming solvers.

189
00:07:54.305 --> 00:07:56.480
Let's try to address this now.

190
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.690
The main issue we can
see here has to do with

191
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.220
the equality constraints of

192
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.275
the final position and heading.

193
00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:07.075
Because equality constraints
must be satisfied exactly,

194
00:08:07.075 --> 00:08:09.590
it is quite hard for
a numerical optimizer

195
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.050
to generate a feasible
solution from

196
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.780
an infeasible starting point
which is often what is given

197
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.085
to the optimizer for
an arbitrary problem instance.

198
00:08:18.085 --> 00:08:20.185
To alleviate this issue,

199
00:08:20.185 --> 00:08:22.040
it is common in optimization to

200
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.720
soft inequality constraints

201
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.820
to improve optimizer performance.

202
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.000
Soft constraints convert
a strict constraint

203
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.630
into a heavily penalized term
in the objective function.

204
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.760
By heavily penalized,
we mean that

205
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.340
the constraint penalty
term coefficient

206
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.500
should be at least an
order of magnitude

207
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.830
larger than the general
optimization objective.

208
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.140
Although this allows
the optimizer to

209
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.140
violate the boundary condition
equality constraints,

210
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.910
the optimizer will be strongly

211
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.640
encouraged to converge
to a solution that is as

212
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.720
close as possible to
the boundary conditions before

213
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.590
the bending energy
penalty term will be

214
00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.290
large enough to
influence the optimizer.

215
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.030
We will also assume that

216
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.550
our initial curvature is
known and is usually set to

217
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:08.240
zero which corresponds to
a naught equal to zero.

218
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.510
This reduces the number of
optimization variables by one.

219
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.430
After softening
these constraints,

220
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.610
our new optimization problem
is as follows.

221
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.880
We have one further issue
we need to address before

222
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.590
defining the final version of

223
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.825
our optimization
to be implemented.

224
00:09:23.825 --> 00:09:26.240
The final issue we
can address has to

225
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.775
do with the optimization
parameters.

226
00:09:28.775 --> 00:09:31.460
While there is
more intuition to using

227
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.790
the cubic spiral coefficients
in our objective function,

228
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.160
we can actually reduce
the number of parameters

229
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.590
we are searching over
by taking the final

230
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.790
curvature boundary constraint
into consideration.

231
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.230
Let's redefine our cubic spiral

232
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.955
using a different set
of parameters

233
00:09:46.955 --> 00:09:51.015
denoted by the vector p
where p has five elements.

234
00:09:51.015 --> 00:09:53.765
First, we have p
naught through p3,

235
00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:56.200
which denote the curvature
at the start,

236
00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.060
one-third point and two-thirds
point and the endpoint.

237
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.715
The final term p4 is the
final arc length of the path.

238
00:10:04.715 --> 00:10:07.910
Conveniently, we have
a closed form mapping between

239
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.320
the curvature parameter and

240
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.305
the spiral parameters
as shown here.

241
00:10:12.305 --> 00:10:14.780
We can therefore
easily compute all

242
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.000
of our constraints and
objective terms as

243
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.265
a function of
these new p variables

244
00:10:19.265 --> 00:10:21.830
instead of the coefficients
of the spiral.

245
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.170
Once the optimization is solved,

246
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.420
we can use the
equations here to map

247
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.285
the results back to
the spiral coefficients.

248
00:10:29.285 --> 00:10:32.780
Since we already know
the initial and final curvature,

249
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.820
we can eliminate two
of the variables,

250
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.590
p naught and p3.

251
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.050
This leaves us with
only three variables in

252
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.815
our optimization
problem p1, p2, and p4.

253
00:10:42.815 --> 00:10:44.900
By using the boundary conditions,

254
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.850
we've reduced
the dimensionality of

255
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.160
the optimization
problem which will

256
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.775
result in a significant
computational speedup.

257
00:10:52.775 --> 00:10:57.170
The resulting final optimization
problem is as follows.

258
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.440
We've replaced the function
of the spiral parameters by

259
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.120
the equivalent functions after

260
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.700
remapping to our p parameters.

261
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.240
Note that the initial and
final path curvature p naught

262
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.160
and p3 are constants.

263
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.365
So the optimization
variables are now

264
00:11:12.365 --> 00:11:15.290
only p1, p2, and p4.

265
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.480
This simplification was possible

266
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.740
due to the boundary conditions

267
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.150
of the curvature being known at

268
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.370
the start and
the end of the path.

269
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.605
Now that we've made
these modifications,

270
00:11:24.605 --> 00:11:27.770
we can solve the path planning
problem efficiently and

271
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.300
with greatly reduced chance of

272
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.835
getting stuck in
poor local minima.

273
00:11:31.835 --> 00:11:35.030
Let's summarize what we've
learned in this video.

274
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.420
First, we reviewed
the required boundary conditions

275
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.430
and constraints for this problem.

276
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.280
We then discussed how
to numerically compute

277
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.565
the n positions of a spiral
using Simpson's rule.

278
00:11:46.565 --> 00:11:48.440
We then introduced the bending

279
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.060
energy objective to encourage

280
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.800
smoothness and formed

281
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.490
a generic spiral
optimization problem.

282
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.050
Finally, we re-map
the parameters of

283
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.030
the optimization
function to ensure

284
00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.140
fast convergence to
a feasible solution.

285
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.000
Well, that was a lot of
new information to take in.

286
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.740
We hope that this lesson
has given you

287
00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.235
an in-depth look at how to
perform smooth path planning.

288
00:12:10.235 --> 00:12:12.620
This lesson has tied
together many of

289
00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.490
the topics that we discussed
in modules one and four.

290
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:16.940
So if you felt like some of

291
00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.530
this material was challenging,

292
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.730
feel free to review

293
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.325
those modules before working
through this lesson again.

294
00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:23.510
In our next lesson,

295
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.370
we will be discussing
how to perform

296
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.560
optimization in Python in

297
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.285
order to prepare you to implement

298
00:12:29.285 --> 00:12:32.650
a full path planner.
See you next time.
