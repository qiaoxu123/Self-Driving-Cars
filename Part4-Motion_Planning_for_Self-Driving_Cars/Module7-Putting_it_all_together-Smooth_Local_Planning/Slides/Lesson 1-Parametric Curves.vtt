00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.480
Hi everyone, and welcome to

2
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.640
the final module of course four.

3
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.470
In this module, we'll discuss

4
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.499
the lowest level of
our hierarchical motion planner,

5
00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.195
which is the local planner.

6
00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:32.250
As a reminder,
the local planner is

7
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.380
the portion of the
hierarchical planner that

8
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.660
executes the maneuver
requested by

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.270
the behavior planner
in a collision-free,

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.625
efficient, and
comfortable manner.

11
00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:44.285
This results in
either a trajectory,

12
00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:46.820
which is a sequence
of points in space at

13
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.270
given times or a path
and velocity profile,

14
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.860
which is a sequence of points in

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.340
space with the required
velocities at each point.

16
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.680
This plan can then be given as

17
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.820
the reference input to

18
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.580
the controllers that you
developed in course one.

19
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.770
In this module, we'll build upon

20
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.630
the introductory reactive planner

21
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.820
we developed back in module four,

22
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.650
such that it is able
to handle some of

23
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.150
the nuances presence in

24
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.985
the autonomous driving
motion planning problem.

25
00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:16.070
In particular, we'll move from

26
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.620
the discrete time to
continuous time in order to

27
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.110
produce smooth
parameterized paths

28
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.095
that are easy to track
with our controllers.

29
00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:27.785
In this video, we'll introduce
the path planning problem

30
00:01:27.785 --> 00:01:31.115
and its associated constraints
and boundary conditions.

31
00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:34.640
As well, we'll discuss
parametric curves and

32
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.960
how they are useful for

33
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.255
representing paths
for this problem.

34
00:01:38.255 --> 00:01:39.740
In particular, you should

35
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.330
understand the difference between

36
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.460
splines and spirals in
the context of motion planning,

37
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.945
and the advantages and
drawbacks of each.

38
00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:49.670
So let's get started.

39
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.255
The first step in understanding
the path planning problem

40
00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:56.885
is to first understand its
most fundamental requirements.

41
00:01:56.885 --> 00:01:58.630
For the path planning problem,

42
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.155
this is given
a starting position,

43
00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:02.790
heading, and curvature,

44
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.950
find a path to an ending
position heading and

45
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.940
curvature that satisfies
our kinematic constraints.

46
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.635
In the context of
an optimization,

47
00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:14.380
the starting and
end values can be

48
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.635
formulated as the boundary
conditions of the problem,

49
00:02:17.635 --> 00:02:19.270
and the kinematic motion of

50
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.220
the vehicle can be formulated as

51
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.020
continuous time constraints

52
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.425
on the optimization variables.

53
00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:28.060
In this context,
the boundary conditions

54
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.055
are the conditions
that must hold on

55
00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:32.290
either end point of the path for

56
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.680
a given optimization solution
to be considered feasible.

57
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.259
If these boundary
conditions are violated,

58
00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:40.475
no matter how great the path is,

59
00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:42.830
we haven't achieved
our core objective

60
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.695
of actually getting to
the point we want to get to.

61
00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:48.530
So the path is not useful to us.

62
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.010
These boundary conditions will
influence how we decide to

63
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.840
set up the underlying structure

64
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.385
of the optimization problem.

65
00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:57.875
Let's look at why this is.

66
00:02:57.875 --> 00:02:59.840
For our path planner,

67
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.390
our only kinematic
constraint is going to be

68
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.585
restricting the maximum
curvature along the path.

69
00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:08.920
In general, this is
not easy to satisfy

70
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.460
since there are infinitely

71
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.950
many points along
a continuous path.

72
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.590
Instead, we will
often take samples

73
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.260
of the curvature at
different points along the path,

74
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.475
and constrain the curvature
of each of these points.

75
00:03:21.475 --> 00:03:24.420
Assuming the path is
relatively well-behaved,

76
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.900
this will likely correspond
to the curvature of

77
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.915
the entire path satisfying
the constraint.

78
00:03:29.915 --> 00:03:32.150
To simplify the representation

79
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.750
of our optimization problem,

80
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.265
we're going to define a path
as a parametric curve.

81
00:03:37.265 --> 00:03:39.455
What is a parametric curve?

82
00:03:39.455 --> 00:03:42.710
A parametric curve is a curve
that can be described

83
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.980
as a set of equations
with specific parameters.

84
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.110
These parameters often
denote path traversal,

85
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.045
whether it will be
through arc length

86
00:03:51.045 --> 00:03:53.640
or just varying from zero to one.

87
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.170
For example, here we have
a cubic spline set of

88
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.575
parametric equations for the
x and y positions of a path.

89
00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:05.735
The parameter of the equations
u varies from zero to one,

90
00:04:05.735 --> 00:04:07.280
as we traveled from the start of

91
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.445
the path to the end of the path.

92
00:04:09.445 --> 00:04:12.890
The vector valued function
r contains the x and

93
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.110
y position at each point

94
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.765
corresponding to a given u value.

95
00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:20.450
For autonomous driving,
we often but not

96
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.885
always require the path
to be a parametric curve.

97
00:04:23.885 --> 00:04:25.650
Why is this?

98
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.449
We often focus on planning
methods that optimize

99
00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:30.920
a given path according to

100
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.790
boundary conditions shown here
by Beta naught and Beta f,

101
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.160
kinematic constraints
shown here by Alpha,

102
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.960
and an objective functional
shown here by f. Having

103
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.150
a parametric
representation of the path

104
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.910
make setting up the
optimization problem simpler,

105
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.650
as we have a function we can

106
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.390
directly give to our objective

107
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.260
functional f. Note that
the term functional refers to

108
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.600
mappings that takes a function as

109
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.170
their argument and
return a real value,

110
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.790
so it can be used to
define a cost over

111
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.135
a space of functions or
parametrized curves.

112
00:05:05.135 --> 00:05:08.135
We can contrast
this parametric curve approach

113
00:05:08.135 --> 00:05:10.750
with the reactive planner
in module four,

114
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.220
where we represented
the trajectory and

115
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.550
the path with a sequence
of points in space.

116
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.880
This is known as
a non-parametric path since

117
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.110
the curve we followed did

118
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.495
not have a parametric
representation.

119
00:05:23.495 --> 00:05:25.535
In the field of
autonomous driving,

120
00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:28.910
there are two common types
of path parameterizations.

121
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.940
The first are
quintic splines which are

122
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.980
fifth order polynomial functions

123
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.290
of the x and y
position of the car.

124
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.485
The second type is
the polynomial spiral,

125
00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:42.125
given by a polynomial
curvature function

126
00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.290
with respect to arc length.

127
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.915
Pictured here is
a third order polynomial spiral,

128
00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:49.430
a cubic spiral,

129
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.250
both of these parameterized
curves give us

130
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.600
the means to satisfy

131
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.825
the boundary conditions
we just discussed,

132
00:05:55.825 --> 00:05:58.820
and also offer us
parameters to use in

133
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.740
objective functions to craft

134
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.215
the paths according
to our requirements.

135
00:06:03.215 --> 00:06:06.560
Selecting either of
these has associated tradeoffs.

136
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.505
So let's explore
each more deeply.

137
00:06:09.505 --> 00:06:12.725
First, let's discuss
the quintic spline.

138
00:06:12.725 --> 00:06:15.800
The quintic spline is
given by two equations,

139
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.600
one for the
progression of x along

140
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.075
the spline and one for y.

141
00:06:20.075 --> 00:06:22.340
Here we can see that
the quintic spline

142
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.749
has 12 parameters,

143
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:27.125
six for the x equation and
six for the y equation.

144
00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:29.030
These parameters correspond to

145
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.830
the polynomial coefficients that

146
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.870
form the shape of the curve.

147
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.520
The traversal parameter u
is fairly arbitrary here.

148
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.940
For simplicity, we take it

149
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.070
to be in the range
of zero to one.

150
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.650
What this means is that u equals

151
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.770
zero corresponds to
the start of the path,

152
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.735
and u equals one
corresponds to the end.

153
00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:50.960
A nice property of
the quintic spline is that for

154
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.470
given position heading and
curvature boundary conditions,

155
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.139
there is an immediate
closed form solution

156
00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:59.975
for the spline coefficients
that satisfy them.

157
00:06:59.975 --> 00:07:03.050
The solution is quite long
so we won't listed here,

158
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.690
but it is still cheaper
to evaluate than

159
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.020
generating a path using an
iterative optimization method.

160
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.845
See the supplemental materials
for a full listing.

161
00:07:12.845 --> 00:07:16.070
There are also additional
degrees of freedom which can be

162
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.100
further optimize depending
on this application.

163
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.770
This is desirable because
it allows us to generate

164
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:22.940
a feasible solution to

165
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.774
the boundary conditions
immediately,

166
00:07:24.774 --> 00:07:28.385
which can be further
refined in anytime fashion.

167
00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:31.010
The downside with quintic splines

168
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.440
is that it is often
hard to constrain

169
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.540
curvature within a certain set of

170
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.870
bounds as is often required
in autonomous driving.

171
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.030
If we look at
the curvature equation

172
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.395
for a parametric curve,

173
00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:44.960
we can see that for
our quintic splines,

174
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.685
the curvature as a function of

175
00:07:46.685 --> 00:07:50.165
arc length will not in
general be a polynomial.

176
00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:52.730
This has the potential
to introduce

177
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.100
cusps or even discontinuities

178
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.635
of the curvature in the spline,

179
00:07:56.635 --> 00:07:59.420
which makes it difficult
to approximately satisfy

180
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.950
curvature constraints across

181
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.230
the entire domain of the spline.

182
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.990
We will discuss
these curvature constraints

183
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.210
in more detail in
our next lesson,

184
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.800
where we set up the optimization

185
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.090
problem for path planning.

186
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.525
As an alternative approach,

187
00:08:14.525 --> 00:08:15.905
we can also employ

188
00:08:15.905 --> 00:08:19.010
polynomial spirals to
represent our path.

189
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.360
These curves offer

190
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.730
a closed form equation
for the curvature

191
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.825
of the curve along each point
of its arc length.

192
00:08:26.825 --> 00:08:30.110
For autonomous driving,
it is common to select

193
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.640
a cubic polynomial as

194
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.700
our curvature function
of arc length.

195
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.800
However, higher-order functions
are also acceptable.

196
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.020
The main positive of using

197
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.200
polynomial spirals is that
their structure is highly

198
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.730
conducive to satisfying

199
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.710
the approximate
curvature constraints

200
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.590
that are often required by
the path planning problem.

201
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.460
Since a spiral is a polynomial
function of curvature,

202
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.950
the curvature value will
not change extremely

203
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.055
quickly like it can in
the case of quintic splines.

204
00:08:58.055 --> 00:09:00.740
This means we can
constrain the curvature of

205
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.140
only a few points
in the spiral and

206
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.720
the spiral will
very likely satisfy

207
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.050
the curvature constraints
across the entire curve.

208
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.830
This is highly useful when
performing path optimization,

209
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.620
as the number of constraints
greatly increases

210
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.430
the computational effort
of each optimization step.

211
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:23.360
The downside of using polynomial
spirals is that there is

212
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.250
no closed form solution of

213
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.445
the position and
heading of the spiral,

214
00:09:27.445 --> 00:09:30.225
unlike the case in
the quintic spline.

215
00:09:30.225 --> 00:09:32.210
Therefore, we must perform

216
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.130
an iterative
optimization in order to

217
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.820
generate a spiral that satisfies
our boundary conditions.

218
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.275
As can be seen here,

219
00:09:39.275 --> 00:09:42.580
the position equations
results in Fresnel integrals,

220
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.260
which have no closed
form solution.

221
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.970
We therefore need to use

222
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.890
numerical approximation
techniques to

223
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.335
compute the final end points
of the spiral.

224
00:09:51.335 --> 00:09:53.539
In this module, we
will approximate

225
00:09:53.539 --> 00:09:55.340
these Fresnel integrals using

226
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.340
Simpson's rule shown
here on the third line.

227
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.410
Simpson's rule is
more accurate with

228
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.810
fewer points than
other approximation methods,

229
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.130
which will be useful when we

230
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.635
setup our optimization problem.

231
00:10:06.635 --> 00:10:08.990
When it comes to the strengths

232
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.705
and weaknesses of the spiral,

233
00:10:10.705 --> 00:10:14.195
we almost have a duality
when compared to the spline,

234
00:10:14.195 --> 00:10:16.865
each has a weak point
where the other is strong.

235
00:10:16.865 --> 00:10:19.580
The spline provides
closed form solutions

236
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.515
based on start and
end points alone,

237
00:10:21.515 --> 00:10:23.395
whereas the spiral does not.

238
00:10:23.395 --> 00:10:25.010
The spiral ensures

239
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.170
smooth curvature variation
along the path,

240
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.775
while the spline does not.

241
00:10:28.775 --> 00:10:31.430
You will therefore need
to determine which method

242
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.100
is appropriate depending on
your specific application.

243
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.440
As a brief shorthand,

244
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.245
the spline leads to
computational efficiency,

245
00:10:38.245 --> 00:10:39.545
while the spiral leads to

246
00:10:39.545 --> 00:10:42.890
easier implementation of
curvature constraints.

247
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.230
For this module, we will focus on

248
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.350
the polynomial spirals as we
develop our path planner,

249
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.150
as we have a strong interest in

250
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.830
ensuring the paths generated by

251
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.480
our local planner can be

252
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.190
executed smoothly and
safely by the vehicle.

253
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.180
However, many of
the techniques described going

254
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.525
forward can also be applied
to quintic splines.

255
00:11:02.525 --> 00:11:04.490
Let's summarize this lesson.

256
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.400
We gave you an overview of
the boundary conditions and

257
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.080
parametric curves used in

258
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.150
autonomous driving path planning,

259
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.490
and we introduced splines and

260
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.175
spirals as alternative
path representations,

261
00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:17.780
and discuss their differences

262
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.745
in the path planning context.

263
00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:21.190
In our next lesson,

264
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.780
we'll be discussing how to
set up the path planning

265
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.080
optimization problem
using the cubic spiral

266
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.810
parametrization we
discussed in this lesson,

267
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.630
as well as the constraints
and objective functions

268
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:37.000
we defined earlier in this
course. We will see you there.
