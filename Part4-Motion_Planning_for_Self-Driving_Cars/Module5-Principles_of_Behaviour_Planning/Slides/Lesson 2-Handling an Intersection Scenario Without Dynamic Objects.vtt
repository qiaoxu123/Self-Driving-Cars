00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.470
In the last video, we

2
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.855
introduced the concept
of a behavior planner,

3
00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:20.460
and described the basics of

4
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.475
the finite state machine to
implement behavior planning.

5
00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:26.160
In this video, we will
see how to build out

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.525
our system to handle

7
00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:29.925
a more complete
intersection scenario.

8
00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:31.710
We will start by defining

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.540
the specifics of the scenario
that will be handled.

10
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.380
We will then look at how we can

11
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.720
discretize the
intersection map into

12
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.790
sections to establish clear
transitions between states.

13
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.280
Then we will define the states
and transitions which are

14
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.690
required to complete

15
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.180
the given scenario
safely and efficiently.

16
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.889
To finish this video,

17
00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:53.840
we will highlight the
testing procedure

18
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.190
required to confirm

19
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.350
the correctness and accuracy of

20
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.275
our behavior planning
system. Let's begin.

21
00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:02.750
The scenario which we
will be attempting to

22
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.225
handle is a four-way
intersection,

23
00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:08.705
with two lanes and stop
signs for every direction.

24
00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:12.259
A diagram of such an
intersection can be seen here,

25
00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.760
where the red lines represent

26
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.760
the stop lines which the car
is required to stop behind.

27
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.265
By the end of the video,

28
00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:21.665
this vehicle should be
able to travel left,

29
00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:24.470
right, or straight through
this intersection.

30
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.250
We'll leave dynamic objects
out of the scenario for now,

31
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.885
and we'll address them
in the next video.

32
00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:31.820
We've now defined a very

33
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.980
restricted operational
design domain

34
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.080
for our behavior
planner to handle.

35
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.455
It's now time to implement
the behavior planner.

36
00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:42.410
Let's start by looking
at how to discretize

37
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.240
an intersection so
that we can more

38
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.020
simply make decisions
in the environment.

39
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.220
The area of
the intersection where

40
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.500
a vehicle should
begin safely braking

41
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.990
is defined as
the approaching zone

42
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.005
of the intersection,
highlighted in red.

43
00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:59.240
The zone of the
intersection in which

44
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.400
the vehicle must
stop and wait until

45
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.890
the appropriate time
to proceed will be

46
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.190
known as the at zone,
highlighted in green.

47
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.430
Finally, the zone in which
the vehicle is crossing

48
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.290
the actual intersection is

49
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.490
defined as on the intersection,

50
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.080
and is highlighted in orange.

51
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.610
The size of each
of the above zones

52
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.200
are dynamically changed based

53
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.770
on two primary factors:
the ego vehicle speed,

54
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.900
at higher speed, we will require

55
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.780
more distance to safely
and comfortably stop,

56
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.925
and the size of the intersection.

57
00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:33.395
The bigger the intersection,

58
00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:35.720
the bigger each zone has to be.

59
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.400
To handle this scenario,

60
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.645
we will require three
high-level driving maneuvers.

61
00:02:40.645 --> 00:02:43.385
Track speed,
this maneuver state is

62
00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:46.265
only bounded by the current
speed limit of the road.

63
00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.590
Traditionally, this
is the maneuver given

64
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.470
before entering any region
of the intersection,

65
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.205
or after entering the on
the intersection zone safely.

66
00:02:55.205 --> 00:02:58.685
The state entry action
sets the speed limit.

67
00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:02.420
Decelerate to stop,
this maneuver state forces

68
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.250
the future trajectory
of the object to

69
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.470
stop before reaching
the stop point.

70
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.045
The entry action defines
the stop point location.

71
00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:12.680
Stop, this maneuver tells

72
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.620
the vehicle to stay stopped
in its current location.

73
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.650
The entry action is to
start a timer to wait for

74
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.850
a fixed amount of time

75
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.445
before proceeding through
the intersection.

76
00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:25.020
We will now look at
the different situations

77
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.920
the ego vehicle will
encounter in this scenario,

78
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.500
and figure out the finite
state machine elements

79
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.010
needed to encode the correct
behavior planning solution.

80
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.650
Let's start by looking
at the ego vehicle

81
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.290
before it enters
the intersection region,

82
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.820
where it has
a single constraint to

83
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.770
follow the speed limit
of the road.

84
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.840
This constraint is set based on

85
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.705
the entry action of
the track speed state.

86
00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:49.970
When the ego vehicle enters

87
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.890
the approaching zone,
the red zone,

88
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.370
it must begin decelerating
to the stop sign,

89
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.950
thus will transition to
the decelerate to stop state.

90
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.400
The transition condition on
moving from track speed to

91
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.990
decelerate to stop is

92
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.725
therefore entry into
the approaching zone.

93
00:04:05.725 --> 00:04:07.870
Then, once decelerating,

94
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.890
the next maneuver which
the autonomous vehicle

95
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.750
must execute is to come to

96
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.985
a full stop before the stop line,

97
00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:16.970
or in the at zone of
the intersection.

98
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.605
To make sure this happens,

99
00:04:18.605 --> 00:04:19.850
the vehicle stays in

100
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.370
the decelerate to stop
state until it has

101
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.510
both a zero velocity and
a position within the at zone.

102
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.210
The entry action in
the decelerate to stop

103
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.245
state is the establishment
of a safe stop location.

104
00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:35.485
Due to the simplicity
of this scenario,

105
00:04:35.485 --> 00:04:37.285
this is a single stop location,

106
00:04:37.285 --> 00:04:39.140
the stop line as given to

107
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.570
the planner by
the high-definition roadmap.

108
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.240
This, however, we will
see in the next lesson,

109
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.995
will become harder to do once

110
00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:49.310
other dynamic objects interact
with the ego vehicle.

111
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.615
Once fully stopped, the car
enters the stop state.

112
00:04:53.615 --> 00:04:55.190
As the entry action,

113
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.230
a timer is started to make sure

114
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.450
that the vehicle stays
in the stopped state

115
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.770
for three seconds before

116
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.520
proceeding in accordance
with typical driving rules.

117
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.565
Once the timer is complete,

118
00:05:06.565 --> 00:05:08.570
the planner automatically
transitions

119
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.550
to the track speed state and

120
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.530
follows the route
provided to it by

121
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.825
the mission planner
through the intersection,

122
00:05:14.825 --> 00:05:17.825
be at left, right,
or straight through.

123
00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:20.660
This is all the required
computation to handle

124
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.370
the simple four-way intersection

125
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.975
with the finite state machine.

126
00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:26.945
Throughout this process, it
is vitally important that we

127
00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:31.160
understand how we the human
expert analyze the scenario,

128
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.425
and what the specific
capabilities

129
00:05:33.425 --> 00:05:35.710
of the resulting
behavior planner are.

130
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.580
These need to be captured in

131
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.280
the operational design
domain definition,

132
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.200
and we need to ensure
that we create

133
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.060
a complete state machine able to

134
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.100
handle every possible
case that can

135
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.760
arise for the given scenarios.

136
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.740
One particular issue that has

137
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.540
a big impact on
the performance of

138
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.425
our state machine is the issue
of noise in the inputs.

139
00:05:56.425 --> 00:06:00.290
The state transition conditions
defined above are exact,

140
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.815
and rely on the vehicle
reaching the stop point

141
00:06:02.815 --> 00:06:05.515
and achieving
a zero velocity exactly.

142
00:06:05.515 --> 00:06:08.620
Even with no other dynamic
objects to detect,

143
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.440
the localization estimates
of the vehicle state may

144
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.125
contain noise and not satisfy
these conditions exactly.

145
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.190
To handle this type
of input noise,

146
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.555
we can introduce
noise threshold hyperparameters.

147
00:06:20.555 --> 00:06:23.230
This is a small
threshold value allowing

148
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.770
speeds close to zero to
be accepted as stopped.

149
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.480
We will continue to see

150
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.485
these hyperparameters more
and more in the next lesson,

151
00:06:31.485 --> 00:06:33.680
when handling
more complex scenarios

152
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.720
with dynamic objects.

153
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.520
Now that we've finished

154
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.350
creating the finite
state machine,

155
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.260
how do we test if it works?

156
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.360
Well, traditionally, there
are four stages of testing

157
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.550
required to confirm functionality

158
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.335
of a behavior planning system,

159
00:06:48.335 --> 00:06:50.240
which follow from
our discussion of

160
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.815
safety assessment for
the full vehicle in course 1.

161
00:06:53.815 --> 00:06:56.800
First, we perform
code-based tests,

162
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.340
which are done to confirm that

163
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.650
the logic of the code is correct.

164
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.340
For example, code-based tests
can tell the programmer if

165
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.800
the speed limits set
in the roadmap will be

166
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.575
the speed limit produced by
the finite state machine.

167
00:07:09.575 --> 00:07:11.990
However, these checks
are incapable of

168
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.140
confirming if the state
transitions are correct,

169
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.075
or if the states are
capable of handling

170
00:07:17.075 --> 00:07:19.600
all of the situations
in a given scenario.

171
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.550
For this, we have to
see if the program code

172
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.240
correctly handles
all situations as intended.

173
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.495
Next, we move to
simulation testing,

174
00:07:29.495 --> 00:07:32.990
which is performed in a simulated
environment like Carla,

175
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.670
in which the state
machine performs

176
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.295
the scenarios which it
was designed to handle.

177
00:07:37.295 --> 00:07:40.130
This type of testing
is able to confirm if

178
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.660
the state machine transitions

179
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.900
and state coverage are correct.

180
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.950
The number of tests performed in

181
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.095
the simulation should
be representative of

182
00:07:48.095 --> 00:07:51.650
all possible situations which
can be seen when driving

183
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.375
the scenario to catch

184
00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:56.080
any edge cases which
programmers might have missed.

185
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.940
Many times selecting
a representative

186
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.220
set of tests is not trivial,

187
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.760
especially as the complexity
of the scenarios increases.

188
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.020
We then move into
closed track testing,

189
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.010
once confident that
the state machine

190
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.485
performs as intended
in simulation.

191
00:08:12.485 --> 00:08:14.390
This type of testing tests

192
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.340
specific scenarios which are hard

193
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.680
to confirm exactly in simulation,

194
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.020
such as parameter
tuning and noise,

195
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.700
and errors in
the perception output

196
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.480
in a real environment.

197
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.700
Finally, we proceed to
on-road validation testing.

198
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.740
Whereas all previous tests were

199
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.095
performed in a highly
controlled environment,

200
00:08:33.095 --> 00:08:35.540
road tests can be
highly unpredictable,

201
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.220
and often break the system in

202
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.980
a manner otherwise not
imagined by engineers.

203
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.530
New variations on
scenarios can then be

204
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.580
incorporated into earlier stages
of the testing process.

205
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.295
Let's review what we've
learned in this video.

206
00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.500
We first defined the scenario and

207
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.840
the operational design
domain to be handled,

208
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.880
a single intersection scenario

209
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.190
with a stop sign
in all directions.

210
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.230
We then saw how the intersection

211
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.670
can be discretized so that

212
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.380
each zone can be used when

213
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.555
making the transitions
of the state diagram.

214
00:09:06.555 --> 00:09:08.600
We then built up the states

215
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.180
in transitions at the system
to correctly define

216
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.110
the required behaviors
throughout the intersection.

217
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.660
Finally, we reviewed
four stages of testing that can

218
00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.380
be used to confirm proper
behaviors in the scenario.

219
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.470
In the next video, we will
show you how to handle

220
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.390
the same intersection scenario

221
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.165
while interacting with
other dynamic objects.

222
00:09:29.165 --> 00:09:31.540
As we will see, this
makes the state machines

223
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.290
significantly more complex and

224
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.150
interesting. We'll see you then.
