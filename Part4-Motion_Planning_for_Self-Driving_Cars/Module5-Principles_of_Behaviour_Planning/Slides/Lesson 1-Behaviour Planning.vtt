00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.565
Welcome to the fifth week of
the motion planning course.

2
00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.710
In this module, we
will be discussing

3
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.940
a very important part of

4
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.700
our motion planning
architecture, behavior planning.

5
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.545
We will start this module off by

6
00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:34.095
introducing the concept
of behavior planning,

7
00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:36.000
and how to construct
the behavior plan

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.640
or using a state machine.

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.875
Then, throughout
the rest of the module,

10
00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:41.690
we will go through the process of

11
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.090
creating a state machine-based
behavior planner,

12
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.660
able to handle
multiple scenarios.

13
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.715
Finally, we will finish off
this module by looking at

14
00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:52.910
alternative approaches to the
behavior planning problem,

15
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.015
to understand their relative
strengths and weaknesses.

16
00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:57.695
In this lesson, we will,

17
00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:01.015
define the requirements for
a behavior planning system,

18
00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:03.920
explore the typical
inputs and outputs

19
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.650
to a behavior planning
module, and finally,

20
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.320
introduce the concept of
finite state machines,

21
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.520
and how they can be used to

22
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.395
create a behavior
planning system.

23
00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:16.130
Let's begin. A behavior
planning system,

24
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.010
plans the set of high level
driving actions,

25
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.080
or maneuvers to safely achieve

26
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.980
the driving mission under
various driving situations.

27
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.760
The set of maneuvers which are

28
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.795
planned should take into account,

29
00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:30.730
the rules of the road,

30
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.630
and the interactions with

31
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.620
all static and dynamic objects
in the environment.

32
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.310
The set of high level decisions
made by the planner must

33
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.960
ensure vehicle safety and

34
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.180
efficient motion through
the environment.

35
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.160
We discussed many
of these concepts

36
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.740
already in course one
of this specialization,

37
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.230
and it is the behavior
planner that needs to make

38
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.790
the right decisions to keep us

39
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.390
moving safely towards our goal.

40
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.680
As an example of the role
of the behavior planner,

41
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.560
let's suppose
the autonomous vehicle

42
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.585
arrives at a busy intersection.

43
00:02:02.585 --> 00:02:05.960
The behavior planner must
plan when and where to stop,

44
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.000
how long to stay stopped for,

45
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.640
and when to proceed
through the intersection.

46
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.340
The behavior planner has
to perform this type of

47
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.579
decision-making in a
computationally efficient manner,

48
00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.200
so that it can react quickly to

49
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.970
changes in the environment,

50
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.430
and be deployed on
an autonomous vehicle hardware.

51
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.840
The behavior planners
should also be able to

52
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.420
deal with inputs that
are both inaccurate,

53
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.495
corrupted by measurement
noise, and incorrect,

54
00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:34.640
affected by perception
errors such as

55
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.340
false positive detections and
false negative detections.

56
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.159
Now that we have the definition

57
00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.975
for the role of the
behavior planner,

58
00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:43.430
let's build a list of

59
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.810
basic behaviors that we'll

60
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.255
work with for the rest
of this module.

61
00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:49.340
We've described most of these

62
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.970
in an earlier video
in this course,

63
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.610
and we'll use this list as

64
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.290
a representation of the set of

65
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.000
likely maneuvers or driving

66
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.195
behaviors encountered
throughout regular driving

67
00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:01.915
that an autonomous vehicle
may need to execute.

68
00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:05.150
In all, we'll consider
five behaviors.

69
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.730
The first is track speed.

70
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.335
This behavior amounts to

71
00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:11.900
unconstrained driving
on open road,

72
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.730
meaning that
the only restriction on

73
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.290
forward progress is that

74
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.405
the speed limit
should be respected.

75
00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:20.435
Next, is follow lead vehicle.

76
00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:22.040
The speed of the vehicle in

77
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.660
front of the ego
vehicle should be

78
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.860
matched and a safe

79
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.110
following distance
should be maintained.

80
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.975
The third is decelerate to stop.

81
00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:31.700
A stop point exists in

82
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.610
the ego vehicle's lane
within the planning horizon,

83
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.620
and the vehicle
should decelerate to

84
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.020
a standstill at that stop point.

85
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.180
Every regulatory element that

86
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.545
requires a complete stop
triggers this behavior.

87
00:03:44.545 --> 00:03:47.250
Next, we have stay stopped.

88
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.250
The vehicle should
continue to stay

89
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.665
stationary for
a fixed amount of time.

90
00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:54.980
As an example, when the vehicle
stops at a stop sign,

91
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.105
it should stay stopped for
at least three seconds.

92
00:03:58.105 --> 00:04:00.695
Finally, we have
the merge behavior.

93
00:04:00.695 --> 00:04:02.690
The vehicle should
either merge into

94
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.240
the left or right lane
at this time.

95
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.150
This basic list of
maneuvers will serve us

96
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.585
well in developing the
principles of behavior planning.

97
00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:12.575
However, many more behaviors

98
00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:14.330
should be considered in practice,

99
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.890
and the overall complexity of

100
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.785
the behavior planner
will grow as a result.

101
00:04:18.785 --> 00:04:21.680
The primary output of
the behavior planner is

102
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.090
a driving maneuver to be

103
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.580
performed in
the current environment.

104
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.620
Along with the driving maneuver,

105
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.100
the behavior planner also
outputs a set of constraints,

106
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.710
which constrain the local
planning problem.

107
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.990
The constraints which
we will use and

108
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.885
populate throughout
this module include,

109
00:04:38.885 --> 00:04:40.730
the default path from

110
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:41.870
the current location of

111
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.095
the vehicle to
the goal destination,

112
00:04:44.095 --> 00:04:45.770
for many behaviors, this is

113
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.860
the center line of
the ego vehicle's current lane.

114
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.415
The speed limit along
the default path.

115
00:04:52.415 --> 00:04:55.370
The lane boundaries of
the current lane that should be

116
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.265
maintained under
nominal driving conditions.

117
00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.680
Any future stop locations

118
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.810
which the vehicle
needs to arrive at,

119
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.370
and this constraint is only

120
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.645
populated if the relevant
maneuver is selected.

121
00:05:07.645 --> 00:05:10.670
Finally, the set of
dynamic objects of

122
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.910
high interest which the local
planner should attend to.

123
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.760
These dynamic objects
may be important due

124
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.140
to proximity or
estimated future path.

125
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.370
In order for the
behavior planner to be

126
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.485
able to produce
the required output,

127
00:05:24.485 --> 00:05:26.750
it needs a large amount
of information from

128
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.010
many other software systems
in our autonomy stack.

129
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.300
First, the behavior
planner relies on

130
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.285
full knowledge of the road
network near the vehicle.

131
00:05:35.285 --> 00:05:38.930
This knowledge comes from
the high definition road map.

132
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.510
Next, the behavior
planner must know

133
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.960
which roadways to follow
to get to a goal location.

134
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.435
This comes in the form of

135
00:05:46.435 --> 00:05:49.410
a mission path over
the road network graph.

136
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.770
Further, the location
of the vehicle

137
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.810
is also vital to be
able to correctly

138
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.850
position HD roadmap elements

139
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.325
in the local environment
around the vehicle.

140
00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:01.100
Accurate localization
information is also

141
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.175
needed from the localization
system as a result.

142
00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:06.440
Finally, the behavior planner

143
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.260
requires all relevant
perception information,

144
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.790
in order to fully understand

145
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.560
the actions that
need to be taken,

146
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.690
to safely activate the mission.

147
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.480
This information includes, all

148
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.970
observed dynamic objects
in the environment,

149
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.940
such as cars,
pedestrians, or bicycles.

150
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.025
For each dynamic object,
its current state,

151
00:06:26.025 --> 00:06:28.575
predicted paths,
collision points,

152
00:06:28.575 --> 00:06:31.260
and time to collision,
are all required.

153
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.710
It also includes, all observed

154
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.310
static objects in
their respective states,

155
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.760
such as parked vehicles,
construction cones,

156
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.275
and traffic lights, with
an indication of their state.

157
00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:45.665
Finally, it includes
a local occupancy grid map

158
00:06:45.665 --> 00:06:49.205
defining the safe areas
to execute maneuvers.

159
00:06:49.205 --> 00:06:52.250
With all the necessary
information available to it,

160
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.390
the behavior planner must

161
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.520
select the appropriate behavior,

162
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.715
and define the necessary
accompanying constraints

163
00:06:58.715 --> 00:07:01.645
to keep the vehicle safe
and moving efficiently.

164
00:07:01.645 --> 00:07:03.980
To do so, we will
construct a set of

165
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.650
rules either explicitly
or implicitly

166
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.170
that consider all of
the rules of the road

167
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.800
and all of the interactions
with other dynamic objects.

168
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.140
One approach traditionally used

169
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.670
to represent the set of rules

170
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.920
required to solve
behavior selection

171
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.950
is a finite state machine.

172
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.330
Throughout this module,
we will go through

173
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.729
a step-by-step process
of constructing

174
00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:28.535
a finite state machine-based
behavior planner.

175
00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:32.020
We'll discuss some of the
limitations of this approach.

176
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.010
To better understand the finite
state machine approach,

177
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.010
let's walk through
a simple example of

178
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.650
a finite-state machine
for a single scenario,

179
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.900
handling a stop sign
intersection with no traffic.

180
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.535
The first set of components
of a finite state machine,

181
00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:49.425
is the set of states.

182
00:07:49.425 --> 00:07:51.160
For behavior planning system,

183
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.880
the states will represent each

184
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.770
of the possible
driving maneuvers,

185
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.525
which can be encountered.

186
00:07:56.525 --> 00:07:58.845
In our example, we will only need

187
00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:01.049
two possible maneuvers or states,

188
00:08:01.049 --> 00:08:04.345
track speed and
decelerate to stop.

189
00:08:04.345 --> 00:08:06.770
The maneuver decision defined by

190
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.390
the behavior planner is set by

191
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.300
the state of the finite
state machine.

192
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.440
Each state has associated
with it an entry action,

193
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.910
which is the action that is to be

194
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.025
taken when a state
is first entered.

195
00:08:19.025 --> 00:08:20.525
For our behavior planner,

196
00:08:20.525 --> 00:08:22.670
these entry actions
involve setting

197
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.605
the necessary constraint outputs

198
00:08:24.605 --> 00:08:26.835
to accompany the
behavior decision.

199
00:08:26.835 --> 00:08:29.270
For instance, as soon as we enter

200
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.490
the decelerate to stop state,

201
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.865
we must also define the
stopping point along the path.

202
00:08:34.865 --> 00:08:39.140
Similarly, the entry condition
for the track speed state,

203
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.915
sets the speed limit to track.

204
00:08:41.915 --> 00:08:45.475
The second set of components
of the finite state machine,

205
00:08:45.475 --> 00:08:47.330
are the transitions, which

206
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.300
define the movement from
one state to another.

207
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.020
In our two-state example,

208
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.680
we can transition from track
speed to decelerate to stop,

209
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.745
and from decelerate to
stop back to track speed.

210
00:08:58.745 --> 00:09:00.890
Note that there can
also be transitions

211
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.960
which return us to
the current state,

212
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.545
triggering the entry action
to repeat for that state.

213
00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:09.500
Each transition is
accompanied with a set of

214
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.720
transition conditions
that need to

215
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.465
be met before changing
to the next state.

216
00:09:14.465 --> 00:09:17.600
These transition conditions
are monitored while

217
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.735
in a state to determine when
a transition should occur.

218
00:09:20.735 --> 00:09:22.940
For our simple example,

219
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.890
the transition
conditions going from

220
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.215
track speed to decelerate to stop

221
00:09:27.215 --> 00:09:29.510
involved checking
if a stop point is

222
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.480
within a threshold distance
in our current lane.

223
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.250
Similarly, if we have

224
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.545
reached zero velocity
at the stop point,

225
00:09:36.545 --> 00:09:38.600
we can transition from decelerate

226
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.030
to stop back to track speed.

227
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.280
These two-state
example highlights

228
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.630
the most important aspects of

229
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.215
the finite state machine-based
behavior planner.

230
00:09:47.215 --> 00:09:50.690
As the number of scenarios
and behaviors increases,

231
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.610
the finite state
machine that is needed

232
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.875
becomes significantly
more complex,

233
00:09:54.875 --> 00:09:58.810
with many more states and
conditions for transition.

234
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.130
Finite state machines can be

235
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.175
a very simple and effective tool
for behavior planning.

236
00:10:04.175 --> 00:10:05.600
We can think of them as

237
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.280
a direct implementation of

238
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.560
the definition of
behavior planning,

239
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.129
which requires us to define
maneuvers or states,

240
00:10:13.129 --> 00:10:15.185
and local planning constraints or

241
00:10:15.185 --> 00:10:18.680
entry actions that satisfy
the rules of the road and

242
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.195
check safe interaction with

243
00:10:20.195 --> 00:10:22.220
other dynamic and
static objects in

244
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.280
the environment or
transition conditions.

245
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.750
By keeping track of

246
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.830
the current maneuver and

247
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.690
state of the driving environment,

248
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.910
only relevant transitions out of

249
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.980
the current state need
to be considered,

250
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.600
greatly reducing the number of

251
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.180
conditions to check
at each iteration.

252
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.760
As a result of
the decomposition of

253
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.560
behavior planning into a set of

254
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.810
states with transitions
between them,

255
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.770
the individual rules required
remain relatively simple.

256
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.500
This leads to straightforward
implementations

257
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.590
with clear divisions
between separate behaviors.

258
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.320
However, as the number
of states increases,

259
00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.835
the complexity of defining

260
00:10:58.835 --> 00:11:02.470
all possible transitions and
their conditions explodes.

261
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.090
There is also
no explicit way to handle

262
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.850
uncertainty and errors
in the input data.

263
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.470
These challenges mean that

264
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:10.970
the finite-state machine approach

265
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.890
tends to run into difficulties,

266
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.560
as we approach full level
five autonomy.

267
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.900
But it is an excellent
starting point for

268
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.960
systems with restricted
operational design domains,

269
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.645
permitting a manageable
number of states.

270
00:11:23.645 --> 00:11:25.580
We'll look into these limitations

271
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.900
and alternative approaches to

272
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.290
behavior planning in
the final video in this module.

273
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.515
This concludes our introduction
to behavior planning.

274
00:11:33.515 --> 00:11:37.040
In this video, we formulated
a clear definition of

275
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.900
the behavior planning problem and

276
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.980
its role within the overall
motion planning system.

277
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.420
We discussed the standard inputs

278
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.970
and outputs of the
behavior planning module.

279
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.655
We introduced the finite
state machine

280
00:11:49.655 --> 00:11:50.960
and its components,

281
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.610
and applied it to a two-state
behavior planning problem.

282
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.600
From here, we'll start to add

283
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.680
more capabilities to

284
00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.840
our finite-state machine
behavior planner.

285
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.730
In the next lesson,
we will learn how to

286
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.830
handle all the rules
associated with

287
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.020
an intersection scenario without

288
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.450
any dynamic objects.
Well, see you there.
