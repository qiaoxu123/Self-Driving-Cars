00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.530
Welcome to the fourth video

2
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.090
in the behavior planning module.

3
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.920
In the last video, we introduced

4
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.240
dynamic objects into

5
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.520
our finite state machine
behavior planner.

6
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.395
In this video, we will develop

7
00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:27.630
a larger behavior planner
which is able to

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.460
manage the decision process

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.190
for multiple scenarios
simultaneously.

10
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.110
We will do this by introducing

11
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.185
the notion of a hierarchical
finite state machine.

12
00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:40.670
We will also develop a method
to switch between each of

13
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.410
the driving scenarios as
they occur. Let's begin.

14
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.480
So far in this module,

15
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.140
we have developed a finite state

16
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.210
machine behavior planner
that can handle

17
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.740
a single four-way stop

18
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.690
intersection scenario
with dynamic objects.

19
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.540
However, in driving, there are

20
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.105
many such scenarios which
will be encountered.

21
00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:01.850
For example, there are
three-way stop intersections,

22
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.530
traffic light controlled
intersections,

23
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.870
and straight road scenarios,
just to name a few.

24
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.850
While many of these
scenarios share

25
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.680
some similarities largely due

26
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.570
to the logic required
to handle them,

27
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.910
each of the scenarios
can be considered to

28
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.005
require fundamentally
different driving behaviors.

29
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:18.710
One method of handling

30
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.980
these multiple scenarios is
by adding additional states,

31
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.780
transitions and conditions to

32
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.640
a single state machine in

33
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.920
an ever-expanding network
of behaviors.

34
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.310
However, there are several
problems with this approach.

35
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.070
The first problem is that
we would need to develop

36
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.280
additional logic to differentiate
the current scenario,

37
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.690
as well as the rules needed to

38
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.940
handle each scenario
individually.

39
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.320
This quickly runs into a problem
known as rule explosion,

40
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.990
in which the number of
rules required to add

41
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.650
additional scenarios
becomes unimaginably large.

42
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.270
The second problem with

43
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.970
a single state machine is
that due to the number of

44
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.010
extra rules and
transitions that need to

45
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.425
be evaluated at each step,

46
00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:02.300
the computational time required

47
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.200
significantly
increases, and lastly,

48
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.730
such a system is
complicated to create and

49
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.070
maintain as a number of cases

50
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.770
which one must worry
about increases quickly.

51
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.950
Essentially, as the
complexity increases,

52
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.395
we lose all the
advantages of using

53
00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:20.030
a finite state machine that

54
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.010
were highlighted
back in lesson one.

55
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.210
There is however, another
approach we can use.

56
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.919
We can represent
each high level scenario

57
00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.420
as a single state.

58
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.950
This would allow us to create

59
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.690
much simpler transitions in

60
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.185
between the high level
scenario states.

61
00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:38.255
In this example, we can see
that the states represent

62
00:02:38.255 --> 00:02:40.160
a straight road scenario and

63
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.840
the four-way
intersection scenario

64
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.355
we worked with previously.

65
00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:46.070
With each one of these high
level scenario states,

66
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.710
we will store
a low-level state machine

67
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.445
with which we can handle
the scenario independently.

68
00:02:52.445 --> 00:02:55.449
For example, for
the intersection scenario,

69
00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:57.500
the low-level state machine
will be the one

70
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.125
constructed over
the last two lessons.

71
00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:02.480
This method of representation is

72
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.610
known as a hierarchical
state machine,

73
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.275
with the super-states
representing each scenario,

74
00:03:08.275 --> 00:03:09.920
and the sub-states representing

75
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.950
the maneuvers to be
handled in each scenario.

76
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.930
The transitions between

77
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.210
the high level
scenario state machine

78
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.920
would be a rule that defines

79
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.720
when a new scenario
has been entered,

80
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.305
based on the HD roadmap and
dynamic vehicle information.

81
00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:27.755
Let's say we have this simple
hierarchical state machine

82
00:03:27.755 --> 00:03:29.345
with two scenarios,

83
00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:32.135
one for straight road with
a pedestrian crossing,

84
00:03:32.135 --> 00:03:34.940
and another for a stop
sign-based intersection.

85
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.740
To move from the straight road

86
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.485
to the stop sign intersection,

87
00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:40.160
the autonomous vehicle has to be

88
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.965
close to an encounter
with this intersection.

89
00:03:42.965 --> 00:03:45.410
This is done with
a distance check to

90
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.785
the next intersection
along the mission plan.

91
00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:51.260
All the movements
which we have talked

92
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.590
about here is at
the super-state level.

93
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.820
The next question we
have to answer is,

94
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.980
how do we switch
between scenarios

95
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.100
when processing
the sub-state maneuvers?

96
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.400
One method is to
introduce transitions to

97
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.965
key maneuver sub-states out

98
00:04:06.965 --> 00:04:09.605
of the current scenario
super-state.

99
00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:11.270
Let us continue to use

100
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.430
the intersection
scenario as an example.

101
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.920
First, let's
establish which state

102
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.115
will be the key exit state
out of the scenario.

103
00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:21.290
The only way we're able to exit

104
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.420
an intersection is while in

105
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.010
the track speed or follow

106
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.310
leader states after having
passed the intersection.

107
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.465
So let's put the exit
transitions there.

108
00:04:31.465 --> 00:04:34.210
The condition on
the transitions would be to

109
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.495
confirm that this scenario
has indeed been completed.

110
00:04:37.495 --> 00:04:39.220
In this example, we can use

111
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.190
the distance to the next
stop sign intersection.

112
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.590
If this is larger than
a given threshold,

113
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.600
we can exit the
intersection scenario.

114
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.595
With this method of transition,

115
00:04:49.595 --> 00:04:51.220
we were able to also maintain

116
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.710
maneuvers between
scenario switches.

117
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.560
In this case, track speed
in the intersection

118
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.450
super-state will connect to

119
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.730
the track speed of
the next scenario that we enter.

120
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.780
Adding an additional
multi-lane scenario to

121
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.330
this hierarchical state
machine is done by

122
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.090
creating a new super-state
scenario node,

123
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.920
with a sub-state state machine

124
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.470
capable of handling
that scenario.

125
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.730
This type of
finite state machine has

126
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.055
some inherent strengths
and weaknesses.

127
00:05:19.055 --> 00:05:20.900
The strengths of
this approach are

128
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.970
due to it's subdivided nature.

129
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.160
By creating individual
state machines

130
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.930
within each super-state,

131
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.670
this method is able to limit

132
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.620
the computational time
required at

133
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.535
any one time step by
restructuring our sub-space.

134
00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:37.790
This subdivided nature also
makes both testing and

135
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.830
programming of
a hierarchical state machine

136
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.675
significantly easier.

137
00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:44.150
However, the hierarchical
state machine

138
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.895
is not without its problems,

139
00:05:45.895 --> 00:05:48.150
while limiting the number
of rules required,

140
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.970
this approach is still unable to

141
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.415
handle rule explosion completely.

142
00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:55.445
One reason for the large number
of rules is that

143
00:05:55.445 --> 00:05:58.615
all scenarios have fully
separated state machines,

144
00:05:58.615 --> 00:06:00.290
and thus many of the rules are

145
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.880
duplicates of one another in

146
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.545
order to handle similar behaviors
in different scenarios.

147
00:06:05.545 --> 00:06:07.895
Ultimately, the
hierarchical approach

148
00:06:07.895 --> 00:06:09.890
allows the system
designer to handle

149
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.020
a greater amount
of complexity than

150
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.855
a flat single layered
finite state machine.

151
00:06:14.855 --> 00:06:17.810
The idea can be extended
to multiple layers as

152
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.645
long as key states can be
defined at each level.

153
00:06:20.645 --> 00:06:22.670
In reality, the perspective

154
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.950
enforced by
finite state machines,

155
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.920
that a single behavior is
active at any given time,

156
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.795
and that all transitions to

157
00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:32.300
other behaviors can be
explicitly defined,

158
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.430
has a limit on how large a set

159
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.140
of scenarios it can handle.

160
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.720
Nonetheless, it
provides a useful tool

161
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.735
for typical behavior planning
in a self-driving car.

162
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.975
Let's summarize what we've
discussed in this video.

163
00:06:44.975 --> 00:06:46.700
We first introduced

164
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.560
the hierarchical
finite state machine,

165
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.760
which is able to handle

166
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.670
multiple scenarios
simultaneously.

167
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.910
We also discussed how
to transition between

168
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.905
the different driving scenarios

169
00:06:57.905 --> 00:07:00.640
at the super and
sub-state levels,

170
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.950
and we discussed
the capabilities and limits of

171
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.060
behavior planning with

172
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.280
hierarchical finite
state machines.

173
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.740
Join us in our next video
where we will discuss

174
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.500
a range of advanced
research approaches that

175
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.960
are able to solve some of
the issues we've faced so

176
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.540
far with behavior planning.
See you there.
