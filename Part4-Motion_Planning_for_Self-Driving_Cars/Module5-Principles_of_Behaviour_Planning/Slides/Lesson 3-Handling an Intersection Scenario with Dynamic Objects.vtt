00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.650
Welcome to the third video

2
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.150
this week on behavior planning.

3
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.530
In the last video,

4
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.930
we developed a basic
behavior planner using

5
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.670
a finite state machine for

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.145
a four-way intersection
without traffic.

7
00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:28.020
We now focus on incorporating

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.590
traffic interactions in
the same four-way intersection.

9
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.910
In today's lesson, we will
begin by reviewing some of

10
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.085
the interactions with
the dynamic object

11
00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:39.010
covered in previous modules,

12
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.210
which we use throughout
this lesson to

13
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.320
safely interact with

14
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.210
the other objects
in the environment.

15
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.590
We will then extend

16
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.090
the state machine
that we had built in

17
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.980
the previous lesson to include

18
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.235
these interactions
with other vehicles.

19
00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:54.650
Finally, we will briefly
discuss the many edge cases and

20
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.080
various complexities
that occur when

21
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.475
dealing with dynamic
objects. Let's dive in.

22
00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:03.710
Once again, the scenario
we study in this video

23
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.740
is a single lane four-way
stop intersection.

24
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.510
We would like to be
able to travel in

25
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.135
any possible direction
through this intersection,

26
00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:14.380
while now handling interaction
with other vehicles.

27
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.435
Recall that in
the previous lesson,

28
00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:20.180
we broke up the intersection
into three areas or zones.

29
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.850
The approaching zone
highlighted in red,

30
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.260
represents when a vehicle should

31
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.600
decelerate to stop
at the intersection.

32
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.150
The ad zone highlighted in green,

33
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.530
is where the vehicle should stop

34
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.600
prior to entering
the intersection.

35
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.580
The on zone in orange,

36
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.475
which represents
the intersection itself.

37
00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:40.280
The zone's size can be shifted

38
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.865
based on the ego and
dynamic velocities,

39
00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:45.450
as well as the size
of the intersection.

40
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.330
Throughout this
lesson, we will be

41
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.040
focusing on the interactions

42
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.805
with other dynamic objects,
specifically other vehicles.

43
00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:56.215
In order to be able to safely
deal with these vehicles,

44
00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:58.670
one important aspect
is a measurement of

45
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.715
the distance to
various interaction points

46
00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:03.425
with the other objects.

47
00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:05.600
The first distance
measure to consider,

48
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.925
is the distance to
dynamic objects.

49
00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:10.730
This is defined as
the Euclidean distance between

50
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.560
the current ego position to

51
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.365
the center of any dynamic object
in the environment.

52
00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:18.140
The second is the distance
to collision point,

53
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.340
which is the distance to

54
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.240
a potential collision point
with another dynamic object.

55
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.740
Finally, the time to collision is

56
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.120
the time it would take to reach

57
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.995
the given collision point.

58
00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:29.990
Our approach to
calculating this was

59
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.135
discussed in the previous video.

60
00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:35.210
Now let's expand a finite
state machine to

61
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.435
accommodate the added complexity
of the dynamic objects.

62
00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:39.830
We will need to increase

63
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.080
the required maneuvers
to four in order to

64
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.210
correctly handle all interactions

65
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.100
with vehicles in this scenario.

66
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.650
First, let's review
the maneuvers we

67
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.970
included in our first version

68
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.410
of the finite state machine.

69
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.974
These were: track speed,

70
00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:56.030
who's only constraint
is the speed of

71
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.879
the given road,
decelerate to stop,

72
00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.340
which requires the ego vehicle
to decelerate to

73
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.415
a stop point at a specific
location in the environment,

74
00:03:04.415 --> 00:03:08.120
and stop, where we remained
in the stop position.

75
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.780
The new maneuver we need
to add is follow leader.

76
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.990
This maneuver state requires
the ego vehicle to follow

77
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.430
the speed of and

78
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.025
maintain a safe distance
to a lead vehicle,

79
00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:22.415
which is any vehicle directly
in front of it in its lane.

80
00:03:22.415 --> 00:03:24.080
The safe distance is speed

81
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.030
dependent and both safe speed and

82
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.205
safe distance are updated as

83
00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:31.940
entry actions on every iteration
of the behavior planner.

84
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.430
Now that we have all
of the states defined

85
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.590
for our expanded finite
state machine,

86
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.290
we turn to populating
the transitions.

87
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.510
We will do this in
a similar fashion

88
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.800
to the previous lesson,

89
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.770
starting at a given state
and then identifying all of

90
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.970
the transitions out of

91
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.615
that state before
proceeding to the next.

92
00:03:49.615 --> 00:03:51.770
We'll display progress through

93
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.540
the intersection as we define

94
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.030
transitions in
a pictorial representation

95
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.490
of the scenario seen
here on the left,

96
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.280
and we'll build up the finite
state machine on the right.

97
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.380
In each pictorial representation,

98
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.045
the autonomous ego vehicle

99
00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.640
will be denoted by a red arrow.

100
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.890
We will then start as we did in

101
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.960
the previous lesson
with the ego vehicle

102
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.315
being located outside
the intersection

103
00:04:14.315 --> 00:04:16.235
in the track speeds state.

104
00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:18.620
Much as we've seen in
the previous lesson,

105
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.630
the ego vehicle will only move to

106
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.770
the decelerate to stop

107
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.430
state once in
the approaching zone.

108
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.805
However, there is
an additional concern,

109
00:04:26.805 --> 00:04:29.420
the situation in which
another vehicle appears

110
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.435
or enters the lane in
front of the ego vehicle.

111
00:04:32.435 --> 00:04:34.870
In this case, we will
move to attempt to

112
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.215
follow the vehicle by
performing a follow check.

113
00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:41.450
The follow check can be
decomposed into two elements.

114
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.380
A distance check and
a same lane check.

115
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.480
The distance check confirms
that the vehicle is

116
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.600
close enough such that
it should be followed.

117
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.010
In the same lane
check confirms that

118
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.300
the vehicle is actually in

119
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.595
the same lane as the ego vehicle.

120
00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:58.150
In this case, we can use
distance to dynamic object,

121
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.830
which is the Euclidean
distance to

122
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.565
the object and compare
that to a threshold.

123
00:05:03.565 --> 00:05:06.970
There are several methods
which can be employed to

124
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.320
check if the vehicle is in

125
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.375
the same lane as the ego vehicle.

126
00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:12.700
However for simplicity,
we will check if

127
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.100
the lead vehicle is
within the lane limits

128
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.310
and if the heading of

129
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.100
the dynamic object is
within a given threshold

130
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.675
to that of the ego vehicle

131
00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:23.690
indicating it is moving
in the same direction.

132
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.700
In the follow leaders state,

133
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.045
we define only two transitions.

134
00:05:28.045 --> 00:05:30.860
First, the lead vehicle
might exit the lean

135
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.330
before the ego vehicle is

136
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.415
approaching or at
the intersection,

137
00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:38.035
resulting in a switch to
the track speed state.

138
00:05:38.035 --> 00:05:39.590
Or the lead vehicle

139
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.570
drives out of
the current lane, usually,

140
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.090
onto the intersection
when the ego vehicle

141
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.820
is already in the at
or approaching zones,

142
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.620
resulting in a direct transition

143
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.570
to the decelerate to stop state.

144
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.820
We add the transition condition,

145
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.335
that the distance to collision

146
00:05:54.335 --> 00:05:55.880
is greater than the distance to

147
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.070
the stop point when
the ego vehicle

148
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.905
is either in the approach
or add zones.

149
00:06:00.905 --> 00:06:03.010
In this situation,
the ego vehicles

150
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.670
should transition
to decelerate to

151
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.800
stop and set the stop point to

152
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.880
the correct location at

153
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.295
the stop line of
the intersection.

154
00:06:10.295 --> 00:06:13.790
As before, in the decelerate
to stop state,

155
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.430
the ego vehicle
continues decelerating

156
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.210
until the time when it comes
to a stop at the stop line.

157
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.890
Which will result in a switch to

158
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.605
the stop state as seen
in our previous lesson.

159
00:06:24.605 --> 00:06:28.280
However, we once again have
to take into account that

160
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.900
a vehicle is able to pull in

161
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.435
front of the autonomous car
at an intersection,

162
00:06:32.435 --> 00:06:35.590
either from a driveway or
an overtaking maneuver.

163
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.790
Much as before, we perform

164
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.160
the follow check throughout
the decelerate to

165
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.170
stop state when the ego vehicle

166
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.960
is in the approaching
or add zones,

167
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.610
and transition to follow

168
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.055
leader if the check returns true.

169
00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:50.870
In this case however,

170
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.790
the distance check
considers whether

171
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.320
the lead vehicle distance to

172
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.260
collision is less than
the stop point distance,

173
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.000
so that the leader
following modes

174
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.835
should take precedence.

175
00:07:00.835 --> 00:07:03.665
Finally, to complete
our expansion

176
00:07:03.665 --> 00:07:05.290
of the finite state machine,

177
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.705
let's look at the situations
we can face once stopped.

178
00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:10.865
To keep things
simple, we'll assume

179
00:07:10.865 --> 00:07:12.760
a very conservative
driving style,

180
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.915
where our autonomous
car waits until

181
00:07:14.915 --> 00:07:17.135
all vehicles have
cleared the approaching,

182
00:07:17.135 --> 00:07:19.790
at, or on intersections zones

183
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.740
before proceeding through it.

184
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.695
We leave the implementation
of precedents

185
00:07:24.695 --> 00:07:27.700
at the stop sign for you
to explore on your own.

186
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.320
Further, we'll
define simple checks

187
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.510
for a rectilinear intersections,

188
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.300
that identify all vehicles
direction of travel with

189
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.460
four easy labels and only

190
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.020
consider other vehicles moving

191
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.820
straight through
the intersection.

192
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.745
Relative to the ego
vehicles body frame,

193
00:07:43.745 --> 00:07:46.310
a vehicle object with
a relative heading of

194
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.415
between minus 45 and 45 degrees,

195
00:07:49.415 --> 00:07:50.900
will be labeled as going in

196
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.465
the same direction
as the ego vehicle.

197
00:07:53.465 --> 00:07:56.160
A vehicle between minus 45 and

198
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.525
135 degrees relative heading,

199
00:07:58.525 --> 00:08:00.785
will be labeled as
heading to the right.

200
00:08:00.785 --> 00:08:02.660
Between minus 135 and

201
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.510
135 as heading towards
the ego vehicle and finally,

202
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.880
between 45-135 degrees
relative heading,

203
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.200
will be labeled as
going to the left.

204
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.140
This simplification
can be improved using

205
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.690
predicted paths for
the dynamic objects,

206
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.660
especially if additional
perception information is

207
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.925
available to improve prediction

208
00:08:22.925 --> 00:08:26.135
of the direction of travel
through the intersection.

209
00:08:26.135 --> 00:08:30.245
We can now define the transitions
out of the stop state.

210
00:08:30.245 --> 00:08:32.785
Will have two sets
of transitions.

211
00:08:32.785 --> 00:08:35.530
Either follow leader
or track speed,

212
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.990
depending on whether
a vehicle is present within

213
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.519
the lane through the intersection

214
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.740
that satisfies the follow check.

215
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.295
In each case, the transition
conditions change

216
00:08:45.295 --> 00:08:46.510
based on the path through

217
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.795
the intersection required
by our mission plan.

218
00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:52.900
When the ego vehicle
needs to turn left,

219
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.300
any vehicle approaching
from the left, right,

220
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.800
or any oncoming vehicle,

221
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.210
must clear the on

222
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:02.065
intersection zone before
the ego vehicle can proceed.

223
00:09:02.065 --> 00:09:05.080
When the ego vehicle
needs to go straight,

224
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.615
only vehicles approaching
from the left or right,

225
00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:09.430
need to clear the intersection.

226
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.800
Finally, when the ego vehicle
needs to turn right,

227
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.450
only vehicles approaching from

228
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.565
the left need to clear
the intersection.

229
00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:18.410
From this simple definition of

230
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.510
the transitions out
of the stop state,

231
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.070
we hope you can visualize

232
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.675
the additional checks needed

233
00:09:23.675 --> 00:09:25.640
to handle the precedence due to

234
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.820
arrival order at
an intersection and the

235
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.859
possibility that
the other vehicles

236
00:09:30.859 --> 00:09:33.500
might also turn left or right.

237
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.750
The resulting full state machine

238
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.675
includes the following states
and transitions.

239
00:09:38.675 --> 00:09:41.630
While this state machine
is unable to be used on

240
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.340
a real autonomous vehicle due to

241
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.589
the oversimplifications
we relied on,

242
00:09:45.589 --> 00:09:47.525
it serves as a good demonstration

243
00:09:47.525 --> 00:09:49.355
of the process of converting

244
00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.520
a given operational design domain

245
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.200
into a functional
finite state machine.

246
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.150
You're now ready
to start tackling

247
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.250
more complex scenarios with

248
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.475
more complete dynamic
object models.

249
00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:05.300
So far throughout the creation
of a state machine,

250
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.835
we have made one particularly
strong assumption

251
00:10:07.835 --> 00:10:10.205
about how dynamic objects behave.

252
00:10:10.205 --> 00:10:12.485
Namely, that all dynamic objects

253
00:10:12.485 --> 00:10:14.405
obey the rules of the road.

254
00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:16.939
However, this is not
always the case,

255
00:10:16.939 --> 00:10:18.380
and this difficulty leads to

256
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.200
many edge cases that also
need to be considered.

257
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.659
Let's quickly discuss
a few examples

258
00:10:23.659 --> 00:10:26.570
of what can go wrong with
this strong assumption.

259
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.135
The first example
would be when a driver

260
00:10:29.135 --> 00:10:32.300
unintentionally swerves
into oncoming traffic,

261
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.565
entering the lane
of the ego vehicle.

262
00:10:34.565 --> 00:10:37.850
This actually happened
to a Waymo van in 2018,

263
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.290
when a driver careened over

264
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.285
a median into oncoming traffic.

265
00:10:41.285 --> 00:10:43.070
Another example, is of

266
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.540
an aggressive driver
racing through

267
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.920
an intersection even as

268
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.575
the ego vehicle has begun
driving through it.

269
00:10:48.575 --> 00:10:50.555
Another common example, is when

270
00:10:50.555 --> 00:10:53.185
a vehicle fails to stop
at the intersection.

271
00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:55.970
Finally, I will end with
the case of a vehicle

272
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.330
which is parked in close
proximity to the intersection.

273
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.270
If this vehicle is
not tagged as parked,

274
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.590
so that it might be treated as

275
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.055
a static instead
of dynamic object,

276
00:11:06.055 --> 00:11:08.180
our behavior planner
may get stuck in

277
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.035
a deadlock state waiting for
this parked vehicle to move.

278
00:11:12.035 --> 00:11:15.635
This is by no means a complete
set of all possibilities,

279
00:11:15.635 --> 00:11:17.360
and one of the
primary objectives of

280
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.120
behaviors safety
assessment and testing,

281
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.159
is to uncover as many variations

282
00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:24.455
of unexpected behaviors
as possible,

283
00:11:24.455 --> 00:11:26.704
so that they also
can be detected,

284
00:11:26.704 --> 00:11:28.850
categorized, and
incorporated into

285
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.010
the behavior planning
design process.

286
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.060
Just simply uncovering edge
cases is not enough, however.

287
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.770
Rather we must define how

288
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.060
the autonomous vehicles should

289
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.445
react to every one
of these cases.

290
00:11:40.445 --> 00:11:42.800
For this emergency maneuvers such

291
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.170
as a swerve or
a hard break are required,

292
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.245
with many more transitions
and conditions to define.

293
00:11:48.245 --> 00:11:49.670
This is an active area of

294
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.110
research and
development and we've

295
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.195
included some
additional resources

296
00:11:53.195 --> 00:11:54.935
in the supplemental materials,

297
00:11:54.935 --> 00:11:57.205
if you'd like to find out more.

298
00:11:57.205 --> 00:11:59.815
In summary, in today's video,

299
00:11:59.815 --> 00:12:02.780
we learned how we can create
a finite state machine,

300
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.040
able to interact with

301
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.090
dynamic objects which follow
the rules of the road.

302
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.900
We saw why dealing with

303
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.210
dynamic objects is
so challenging by

304
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.560
looking at just a few of

305
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.025
the many possible edge cases
which they can create.

306
00:12:16.025 --> 00:12:17.510
In our next lesson,

307
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.040
we will see how we can continue

308
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.555
building our behavior planner

309
00:12:20.555 --> 00:12:24.080
to be able to handle multiple
scenarios simultaneously.

310
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.340
We'll see you next time.
