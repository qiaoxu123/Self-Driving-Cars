00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.805
Welcome everyone to the
second module of this course.

2
00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:25.770
In this module, we will discuss

3
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.440
the creation of
two environmental maps;

4
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.995
the occupancy grid map and
the high-definition road map.

5
00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:34.350
Both of the maps we
will discuss play

6
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.960
a critical role in the task
of motion planning,

7
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.595
as we will see
throughout this course.

8
00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:41.390
We will start by defining

9
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.310
the occupancy grid map in detail,

10
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.810
and understand how it can be

11
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.060
created on an autonomous vehicle.

12
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.330
We will then try to understand
the noise inherent in

13
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.650
measurement data used for

14
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.155
the creation of an
occupancy grid map.

15
00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:56.570
Finally, you will
see how to handle

16
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.700
this noise in
the measurement data,

17
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.965
by learning about
Bayesian updates of

18
00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:04.055
occupancy grid beliefs.
Let's get started.

19
00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:07.190
An occupancy grid is
a discretized grid

20
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.310
which surrounds the current
ego vehicle position.

21
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.320
This discretization can be

22
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.830
done in two or three dimensions.

23
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.000
The methods we discussed
can be applied

24
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.445
to both two and
three-dimensional problems.

25
00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:22.360
However, to simplify
both the explanations as

26
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.450
well as the computational
requirements in this module,

27
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.550
we will only be focusing
on the 2D version.

28
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.140
Each grid square of the
occupancy grid indicates if

29
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.090
a static or stationary object

30
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.325
is present in that grid location.

31
00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:40.255
If so, that grid location
is classified as occupied.

32
00:01:40.255 --> 00:01:42.940
An example of static
objects that would be

33
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.135
classified as occupying a grid
cell can include trees,

34
00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:48.745
buildings, road signs,
and light poles.

35
00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:50.980
In the domain of
autonomous vehicles,

36
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.310
other objects which you might
not think of as obstacles,

37
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.580
should also be classified
as occupying space,

38
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.770
including all non
drivable surfaces

39
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.185
such as lawns or sidewalks.

40
00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:06.135
Each square of the
occupancy grid noted by Mi,

41
00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:08.935
maps to a binary value
in which one

42
00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:11.925
indicates that the square is
occupied by a static object,

43
00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:14.485
and zero indicates
that it is not.

44
00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:17.290
In this map, we can see
that the squares with

45
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.310
trees and grass cover
are labeled as one,

46
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.625
whereas the road is labeled zero.

47
00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:25.015
The resulting map
looks like this.

48
00:02:25.015 --> 00:02:27.880
All the occupied squares
of the grid are purple,

49
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.680
and the rest of the map
corresponding to

50
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.830
the drivable surfaces
is left transparent.

51
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.040
We will now look at the set
of assumptions that are

52
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.685
made in order to create
an accurate occupancy grid.

53
00:02:39.685 --> 00:02:42.010
First, the environment that

54
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.570
is currently measured to create

55
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.460
this occupancy grid only
corresponds with static objects.

56
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.960
Meaning, all dynamic objects
or moving objects must be

57
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.835
removed from the sensor data

58
00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:55.885
before it is used for
occupancy grid mapping.

59
00:02:55.885 --> 00:03:00.170
Second, each grid cell is
independent of all others.

60
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.270
This assumption is
made to simplify

61
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.590
the update functions needed
to create the occupancy grid.

62
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.110
Finally, the current
vehicle state is exactly

63
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.370
known in relation to

64
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.920
the occupancy map
at every time step.

65
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.800
In the domain of
self-driving cars to

66
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.840
observe distance between the car

67
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.320
and the current state
of the world,

68
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.880
the LIDAR sensor is
used most frequently.

69
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.700
As a quick reminder,

70
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.225
the LIDAR sensor uses
pulses of light to

71
00:03:27.225 --> 00:03:30.680
measure the distance to
all objects surrounding the car,

72
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.390
and returns a point cloud of

73
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.095
measurements throughout
its field of view.

74
00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:39.125
In this video, we can see
the output of the LIDAR sensor.

75
00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:42.350
Several components of the LIDAR
data need to be filtered

76
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.090
out before this data can be

77
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.480
used to construct
an occupancy grid.

78
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.480
The first step is to filter

79
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.680
all LIDAR points which
comprise the ground plane.

80
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.510
In this case, the ground plane is

81
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.770
the road surface which

82
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.350
the autonomous car
can safely drive on.

83
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.560
Next, all points
which appear above

84
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.515
the highest point of the vehicle
are also filtered out.

85
00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:06.260
This set of LIDAR points
can be ignored as

86
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.820
they will not impede
the progression

87
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.340
of the autonomous vehicle.

88
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.370
Finally, all non-static
objects which had

89
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.250
been captured by the LIDAR
need to be removed.

90
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.780
This includes all vehicles,

91
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.465
pedestrians, bicycles,
and animals.

92
00:04:19.465 --> 00:04:23.140
Once all filtering of
the LIDAR data is complete,

93
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.170
the 3D LIDAR data will need
to be projected down to

94
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.025
a 2D plane to be used to
construct our occupancy grid.

95
00:04:30.025 --> 00:04:33.070
The filtering and compression
of the LIDAR data to

96
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.310
create accurate occupancy
grids for autonomous cars,

97
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.830
will be covered in
a later video in this module.

98
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.750
The LIDAR data which is now
filtered and compressed,

99
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.275
resembles data from a high
definition 2D range sensor,

100
00:04:47.275 --> 00:04:49.330
which accurately
measures distance to

101
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.025
all static objects around
the vehicle in the plane.

102
00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:55.265
However, there is
still a problem.

103
00:04:55.265 --> 00:04:57.625
After all the filtering
has been completed,

104
00:04:57.625 --> 00:05:00.065
there are still
major map uncertainties

105
00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:03.050
due to the filtering methods
used on the data,

106
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.180
the complexity of
the data at hand,

107
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.630
and most of all, environmental
and sensor noise.

108
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.880
In order to handle this noise,

109
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.645
the occupancy grid will be
modified to be probabilistic.

110
00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:18.845
Instead of cell i storing
a binary value for occupied,

111
00:05:18.845 --> 00:05:20.825
now each cell i will store

112
00:05:20.825 --> 00:05:23.240
a probability between
zero and one,

113
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.950
corresponding to the certainty

114
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.125
that the given square
is occupied.

115
00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:29.090
The higher the value stored,

116
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.590
the higher the probability that

117
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.675
the given square is occupied.

118
00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:35.075
To use this set of probabilities,

119
00:05:35.075 --> 00:05:37.730
the occupancy grid can
now be represented as

120
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.340
a belief map denoted by
the term B-E-L are bel.

121
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.760
To keep notations simple,

122
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.530
Mi represents a single square
of the occupancy grid,

123
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.785
where i can be constructed
from measurements Y,

124
00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:54.310
and the vehicle location X.

125
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.570
The belief over Mi is

126
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.150
equal to the probability
that the current cell

127
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.010
Mi is occupied given

128
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.250
the sensor measurements gathered
for that cell location.

129
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.280
To convert back to a binary map,

130
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.845
a threshold value can
be established at which

131
00:06:09.845 --> 00:06:11.450
a given belief is confident

132
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.330
enough to be classified
as occupied.

133
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.715
Any value below the set
threshold will be set to free.

134
00:06:18.715 --> 00:06:21.680
As an example,
the occupied square in

135
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.160
the figure to the left has
a probability of 0.94,

136
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.620
which classifies
the square is occupied.

137
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.030
On the other hand, the square

138
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.500
found on the street only has

139
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.590
a probability of 0.12
of being occupied,

140
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.890
and thus will be classified
as a free location.

141
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.140
Multiple sets of
measurements can be

142
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.000
combined from time one to time

143
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.720
t to achieve far more accurate
belief of occupancy.

144
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.060
In fact, we can update beliefs in

145
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.750
a recursive manner so
that at each time step t,

146
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.120
we use all prior information from

147
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.935
time one onwards to
define our belief.

148
00:06:56.935 --> 00:07:00.615
The belief at time t
over the map cell Mi

149
00:07:00.615 --> 00:07:03.590
is defined as
the probability that Mi is

150
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.005
occupied given all measurements

151
00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:08.060
and the vehicle
position from time

152
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.260
one to t. To

153
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.430
combine multiple measurements
into a single belief map,

154
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.605
Bayes theorem can be applied.

155
00:07:15.605 --> 00:07:17.990
In the case of the
occupancy grid,

156
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.835
we get a Bayesian update step

157
00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:21.925
that takes the following form.

158
00:07:21.925 --> 00:07:26.265
The distribution p
of y_t given Mi,

159
00:07:26.265 --> 00:07:27.845
is the probability of getting

160
00:07:27.845 --> 00:07:32.150
a particular measurement
given a cell Mi is occupied.

161
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.190
This is known as
the measurement model,

162
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.480
which you studied in
detail in course two.

163
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.470
The belief at time T minus
one over Mi corresponds to

164
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.570
the prior belief stored in

165
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.405
our occupancy grid from
the previous time step.

166
00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:50.090
We rely on the Markov assumption,

167
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.850
that all necessary
information for estimating

168
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.160
cell occupancy is captured

169
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.320
in the belief map
at each time step.

170
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.540
So no earlier history needs to be

171
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.395
considered in
the cell update equations.

172
00:08:02.395 --> 00:08:04.940
Finally, eta in this case

173
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.499
corresponds to a normalizing

174
00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:08.600
constant applied
to the belief map.

175
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.880
This is needed to scale
the results to make

176
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.925
sure it remains
a probability distribution.

177
00:08:13.925 --> 00:08:17.495
Lets see an occupancy
grid in action.

178
00:08:17.495 --> 00:08:19.400
In this video, we will follow

179
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.230
the autonomous vehicle as it

180
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.750
drives out of the driveway
and down a road,

181
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.155
while the occupancy grid
is updating in real time.

182
00:08:27.155 --> 00:08:30.470
The lighter grid cells
represent free squares,

183
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.025
whereas the black grid cells
represent occupied squares.

184
00:08:34.025 --> 00:08:37.520
We can also see
the raw LIDAR data in red,

185
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.755
and the filtered
outputs in orange.

186
00:08:39.755 --> 00:08:42.770
Notice how the map tracks
the vehicle motion which is

187
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.899
estimated using
the same techniques

188
00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:47.610
as we've presented in course two.

189
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.430
In this video, the threshold of

190
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.310
belief needed for an object to be

191
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.270
classified as obstructing
is set to very high,

192
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.460
thus only large static objects

193
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.380
are getting identified
as occupied.

194
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.630
Lowering this threshold
value will result

195
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.000
in more cells to be
tagged as occupied,

196
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.840
but will lead to noisier
maps as well. All right.

197
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.225
So let's summarize what
you've just learned.

198
00:09:11.225 --> 00:09:12.860
In this video, you learned

199
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.980
the basic definition of
the Occupancy grid map,

200
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.130
and saw how the LIDAR
sensor data can be filtered

201
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.385
and compressed to create
an occupancy grid.

202
00:09:22.385 --> 00:09:24.470
You then learned how to represent

203
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.810
the occupancy grid
as a belief map,

204
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.270
and applied Bayesian updates to

205
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.705
incorporate new measurements
in the occupancy grid.

206
00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:34.520
In the next video,

207
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.890
we will discuss some of
the numerical problems

208
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.620
with our belief space
map representation,

209
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.735
and introduce the logit function

210
00:09:41.735 --> 00:09:43.730
as a solution to this problem.

211
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.260
We will also look at

212
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.110
an inverse measurement model
which is needed to create

213
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.095
the occupancy map grid
from 2D LIDAR data

214
00:09:51.095 --> 00:09:55.170
using the logit function.
See you there.
