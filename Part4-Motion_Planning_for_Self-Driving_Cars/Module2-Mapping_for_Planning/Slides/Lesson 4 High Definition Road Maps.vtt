00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.435
Welcome everyone to
the final lesson of module two.

2
00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.700
We will finish
this week on mapping by

3
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.965
looking at another
essential map type,

4
00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:25.020
the High Definition Road Map.

5
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.935
In this video, we will define
a High-Definition Road Map.

6
00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:31.830
We will then see how
this map can effectively be

7
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.340
stored by looking at a datatype
called the lanelet Map.

8
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.460
We will then take a look at

9
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.040
two main elements
of the lanelet map;

10
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.010
the lanelets and
the intersection elements,

11
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.260
and discuss how
they are connected.

12
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.360
Each of the elements
will then be broken

13
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.100
down into its components,

14
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.020
so we can explore the full extent

15
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.030
of this mapping data structure.

16
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.520
Next, we look at
the different operations that

17
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.010
can be performed on
lanelet elements.

18
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.905
Finally, we will explore
different methods

19
00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:04.205
of recording and
creating lanelet maps.

20
00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:07.340
A High-Definition Road Map
is similar to

21
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.810
traditional paper-based maps
or online maps.

22
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.340
However, the information
contained within

23
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.540
the High Definition map or

24
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.690
HD map is significantly
more detailed.

25
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.670
While a traditional map stores

26
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.860
the approximate
locations of roads,

27
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.810
the High Definition
Road Maps stores

28
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.315
the precise road
locations including

29
00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:29.465
all lanes down to
a few centimeters accuracy.

30
00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:30.905
Along with this,

31
00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:32.990
the High Definition
Road Maps stores all of

32
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.970
the locations of road signs and

33
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.930
signals which might effect
the autonomous vehicle.

34
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.515
Due to the detailed and

35
00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:41.630
interconnected nature
of the data,

36
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.700
an effective method
is required to

37
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.655
store all information
contained within the map.

38
00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:49.250
The lanelet concept
was proposed in

39
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.680
a 2014 publication entitled,

40
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.020
Lanelets: Efficient
Map Representation

41
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.450
for Autonomous Driving
by Philip Bender,

42
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.720
Julius Ziegler, and
Christoph Stiller.

43
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.650
Due to this method's
effectiveness

44
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.450
in storage and communication

45
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.840
of the complex set of information
needed for HD mapping,

46
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.850
it is widely used.

47
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.470
We'll look at this framework
for the rest of the course,

48
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.400
and they will play a key role in

49
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.100
our behavior planning
methods in particular.

50
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.039
The lanelet map has
two main components,

51
00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.875
which we will discuss in
greater detail in this lesson.

52
00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.540
A lanelet element which

53
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.790
stores all information
connected to

54
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.680
a small longitudinal segment of

55
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.580
a lane on a road
which it represents.

56
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.275
An intersection element
which stores

57
00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:35.420
all lanelet elements
which are part of

58
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.920
a single intersection for

59
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.420
simple retrieval during
motion planning tasks.

60
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.280
This will be followed
by an explanation of

61
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.735
the connectivity between

62
00:02:44.735 --> 00:02:47.345
all the different
lanelet elements.

63
00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:50.930
A lanelet elements has
several sets of information that

64
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.305
stores about the segment of
road that it represents.

65
00:02:54.305 --> 00:02:56.440
First, a lanelet stores

66
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.735
the left and right boundaries
of the given lane.

67
00:02:59.735 --> 00:03:01.925
Second, a lanelet stores

68
00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:04.130
any regulatory elements
that might be

69
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.725
present at the end of
the lanelet element,

70
00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:10.775
such as a stop sign line
or a static sign line.

71
00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:13.460
Note that we only
store a line for

72
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.950
any regulatory element as
this is the point that

73
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.080
the autonomous vehicle treats as

74
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.535
the active location for
that regulatory element.

75
00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:23.655
Third, a lanelet stores

76
00:03:23.655 --> 00:03:26.070
all regulatory attributes that

77
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.275
might affect that
segment of the road,

78
00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:30.190
such as the speed limit.

79
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.485
Fourth, a lanelet
stores the connectivity

80
00:03:33.485 --> 00:03:36.605
of itself to other lanelet
elements around it.

81
00:03:36.605 --> 00:03:40.325
This allows for easy traversal
and calculations

82
00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:41.930
through the graph created by

83
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.600
the set of lanelets in an HD map.

84
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.095
Each lanelet ends as
a regulatory element

85
00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:51.425
or a change to a regulatory
attribute is encountered.

86
00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:54.200
This means that a
lanelet element can be as short

87
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.095
as only a few meters in
the case of a lanelet,

88
00:03:57.095 --> 00:03:58.894
which is part of an intersection,

89
00:03:58.894 --> 00:04:00.410
or can be hundreds of meters

90
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.830
long for a highway road segment.

91
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.760
Boundaries of the lanelet are

92
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.625
represented as the edges
of the lanelet.

93
00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:10.970
These boundaries capture
either marked lane boundaries

94
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.325
or curves which inhibit driving.

95
00:04:13.325 --> 00:04:15.860
Lane boundaries are
stored as a set of

96
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.475
points creating
a continuous polygonal line.

97
00:04:19.475 --> 00:04:21.710
Each point stores its x,

98
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.095
y, and z GPS coordinates.

99
00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:26.180
The distance between points can

100
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.400
be as fine as a few centimeters,

101
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.095
or as course as a few meters

102
00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:33.715
depending on the smoothness
of the polyline in question.

103
00:04:33.715 --> 00:04:36.225
Using this polygonal
line structure,

104
00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:38.599
many useful operations
can be performed

105
00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.795
to gather data for the task
of motion planning.

106
00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:44.480
The ordering of
the points defines

107
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.720
the direction of travel and
heading for the lanelet.

108
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.240
The road curvature of any part of

109
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.300
the lanelet can be precomputed
from that lanelet as well.

110
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.910
A center line between

111
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.310
the two boundaries
can be interpolated,

112
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.470
which can be used as
the desired path of

113
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.875
travel for the autonomous
vehicle in that lane.

114
00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:05.900
There are two types of

115
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.675
lanelet regulations:
Regulation Elements,

116
00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:10.760
which come at the end
of the lanelet,

117
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.680
and regulation attributes, which

118
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.225
affect the entirety
of the lanelet.

119
00:05:15.225 --> 00:05:18.440
Regulatory elements are
represented as lines

120
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.590
which are defined by a set
of co-linear points.

121
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.515
Regulation elements
usually require

122
00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:27.110
an action or decision to be made,

123
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.090
such as in the case
of a traffic light,

124
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.130
or the decision to
proceed must be

125
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.145
based on the current state
of that traffic light.

126
00:05:34.145 --> 00:05:37.070
Regulatory attributes persist for

127
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.125
the entirety of the lanelet.

128
00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:41.530
Examples include speed limits,

129
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.505
or whether this lanelet crosses

130
00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:46.975
another lanelet as in
an intersection or merge.

131
00:05:46.975 --> 00:05:50.370
Each lanelet has
four possible connections:

132
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.320
Lanelets directly to the left,

133
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.940
lanelets directly to
the right, lanelet preceding it,

134
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.825
and lanelet following it.

135
00:05:57.825 --> 00:06:00.050
The entire lanelet structure is

136
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.270
connected in a directed graph,

137
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.615
which is the base structure
of the HD map.

138
00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.850
It should be noted there could be

139
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.135
more than one lanelet
preceding the current lanelet,

140
00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:12.710
or more than one following

141
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.435
lanelet as in the case
of an intersection.

142
00:06:15.435 --> 00:06:17.545
To better understand
this concept,

143
00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:20.120
let's take a look at
a simple example using

144
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.350
this particular set of

145
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.945
lanelets for a
three-way intersection.

146
00:06:23.945 --> 00:06:27.140
As you can see, some
of the lanelets are

147
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.125
numbered and represented
as nodes on the graph,

148
00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:32.525
which therefore
represent only a portion

149
00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:35.225
of the complete lanelet graph
with this intersection.

150
00:06:35.225 --> 00:06:37.400
The nodes or vertices are

151
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.045
labeled one through five
on the lane that figure,

152
00:06:40.045 --> 00:06:43.345
and form the vertices
of the lanelet graph.

153
00:06:43.345 --> 00:06:45.470
All edges of this graph are

154
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.630
directed and are
labeled to denote

155
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.830
the relationship between

156
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.710
the two vertices
the edge connects.

157
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.629
An edge marked as zero

158
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:56.400
represents the transition
to the next lanelet.

159
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.810
A one indicates a connection
to the left lanelet.

160
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.895
An edge labeled two represents

161
00:07:01.895 --> 00:07:04.100
a connection to
the right lanelet,

162
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.925
and a three represents
previously lanelets.

163
00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:08.840
The lanelet element, which is

164
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.090
represented by the number
one in this picture,

165
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.230
has in fact two
possible next elements.

166
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.630
Lanelet element five and
lanelet element two are

167
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.820
two possible next
lanelets that can be

168
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.370
driven on after
leaving lanelet one,

169
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.435
as they are two ways
through this intersection.

170
00:07:25.435 --> 00:07:28.310
Similarly, lanelet
element four is

171
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.625
connected to lanelet
one with a one edge,

172
00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:35.015
as lanelet four is to
the left of lanelet one.

173
00:07:35.015 --> 00:07:37.730
The intersection
elements simply holds

174
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.525
a pointer to
all regulatory elements,

175
00:07:40.525 --> 00:07:43.280
which make up the
intersection of interest.

176
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.560
All lanelet elements
which are part of

177
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.085
an intersection also point to
this intersection element.

178
00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:52.280
This structure acts much
like a container and

179
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.940
simplifies look-ups throughout

180
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.110
the lanelet structure
when assigning behaviors.

181
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.060
A big advantage of

182
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.550
the lanelet data structure
is that it makes parts of

183
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.200
the motion planning process

184
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.930
simpler and more
computationally efficient.

185
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.330
The process of
path planning through

186
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.804
complex multi-lane road networks,

187
00:08:10.804 --> 00:08:12.770
which require
multiple link changes

188
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.645
well in advance of turning,

189
00:08:14.645 --> 00:08:17.510
are made possible with
this data structure as

190
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.620
each lanelet is treated
as a separate vertex.

191
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.080
Localizing dynamic objects to

192
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.405
a known map improves
path predictions,

193
00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:28.670
as we shall see in module four.

194
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.640
This type of localization
ability also improves

195
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.460
interactions with
dynamic objects by

196
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.530
providing an easy method to plan

197
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.540
the behavior of an autonomous car

198
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.935
through a busy intersection,

199
00:08:39.935 --> 00:08:42.200
as we'll see in module five.

200
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.750
The creation of such a map can
be done in three ways: The

201
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.630
first is creating the map
offline by driving

202
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.740
the road network several

203
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.855
times and collecting information,

204
00:08:53.855 --> 00:08:56.690
and then fusing both
segmentation as well as

205
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.030
localization
information to improve

206
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.500
the accuracy of the map.

207
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.230
In this method,
hand corrections are also

208
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.500
possible if any mistakes are
noted from the algorithms.

209
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.620
The second method is to
create a lanelet map

210
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.965
online while driving a road
network for the first time.

211
00:09:12.965 --> 00:09:15.710
With the use of
existing traditional maps and

212
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.055
heavily relying on segmentation
and object detection,

213
00:09:19.055 --> 00:09:21.245
it is possible to
create the map as

214
00:09:21.245 --> 00:09:22.730
the autonomous vehicle drives

215
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.025
through the road network
for the first time.

216
00:09:25.025 --> 00:09:27.650
This method is highly
computationally

217
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.830
expensive both in terms of
the motion planning task,

218
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.885
as well as the perception tasks.

219
00:09:32.885 --> 00:09:34.280
Not to mention highly

220
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.005
error-prone and thus
is rarely deployed.

221
00:09:37.005 --> 00:09:40.920
The third approach for
creating HD maps is to create

222
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.515
the maps offline and then

223
00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:45.335
update them online if
changes are detected.

224
00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.940
One such change might be

225
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.140
a new construction zone

226
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.490
resulting in a new
regulatory element,

227
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.980
and this is something
that could not have

228
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.595
been predicted
during map creation.

229
00:09:54.595 --> 00:09:57.230
In fact, all of these methods use

230
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.390
the same underlying
calculations to

231
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.870
identify lanelet elements,
attributes, and intersections.

232
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.720
In practice, offline
map construction with

233
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.535
live confirmation and updating

234
00:10:07.535 --> 00:10:09.600
captures the best of both worlds,

235
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.480
ensuring high precision on

236
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.180
static elements that do
not change frequently,

237
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.400
and yet still capturing
the novelty in

238
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.520
the environment and allowing
the vehicle to adapt to it.

239
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.590
There is much more
detail that can be

240
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.305
included in this discussion
about HD mapping.

241
00:10:26.305 --> 00:10:27.940
So we've added some links to

242
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.590
the supplemental materials if

243
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.555
you'd like to dive in deeper.

244
00:10:31.555 --> 00:10:33.640
Congratulations, you've made it

245
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.155
to the end of this module.

246
00:10:35.155 --> 00:10:37.510
In this module, you've
learned all about

247
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.330
the creation of two types
of environment maps,

248
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.550
which are required
for motion planning.

249
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.995
We started by looking
at the construction of

250
00:10:44.995 --> 00:10:46.390
occupancy grid maps from

251
00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.760
rider data for self-driving cars.

252
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.670
It's Bayesian log-odds
update steps,

253
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.310
and all the required
filtering needed to

254
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.940
create meaningful maps or
static objects to be avoided.

255
00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.500
We also looked at

256
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.585
High Definition Road Maps
using the lanelet model.

257
00:11:02.585 --> 00:11:05.390
We discussed the various
components which make up

258
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.280
these maps and how they can be

259
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.310
used for fundamental motion
planning operations.

260
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.970
In the next module,

261
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.520
we will look into
the mission planning problem,

262
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.660
the first step in
the task of developing

263
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.670
safe and effective trajectories

264
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.100
for self-driving cars.
See you then.
