00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.590
Hello everyone. Welcome to

2
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.570
the second lesson of this module.

3
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.870
In this video, we will
identify the issues with

4
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.685
the Bayesian
Probability Update step

5
00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:25.905
which we saw in
the previous lesson.

6
00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:28.620
We will then present
a solution to the issues

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.025
highlighted using a log
odds representation.

8
00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:33.810
Finally, in this video,

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.820
we will see the derivation of

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.905
the Bayesian log odds update step

11
00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:41.290
required to update
the belief map.

12
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.340
As we have seen in
the previous video,

13
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.890
we can apply Bayes' theorem to

14
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.230
combine the previous
belief map with

15
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.825
the current measurement
information to create

16
00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:53.960
a highly accurate occupancy grid
at each time step.

17
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.140
This is achieved by
the following function in

18
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.680
which n represents a
normalizing constant,

19
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.110
p of yt given mi is the
current measurement received,

20
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.405
and the belief at time t minus 1

21
00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:11.270
over mi is the
previous belief map.

22
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.520
There is, however, a problem with

23
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.800
using this simple
Bayesian update.

24
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.630
To demonstrate the issue,

25
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.090
we will look at an example
of an update to

26
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.470
an unoccupied cell of

27
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.190
the occupancy grid with
a new unoccupied measurement.

28
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.350
Let's suppose we
have a cell which

29
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.765
previously had a low belief
of occupation,

30
00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:32.615
6.38 times 10 to the minus 4,

31
00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:34.565
and the new
measurement results in

32
00:01:34.565 --> 00:01:36.530
low probability as well,

33
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.170
1.2 times 10 to the minus 5.

34
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.680
This means that the resulting
belief would be very low,

35
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.410
or 8.0 times 10 to the minus 7.

36
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.970
As you can see, all of

37
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.495
these beliefs are
quite close to zero.

38
00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:51.800
Multiplication of
floating-point numbers

39
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.150
on a computer, however,

40
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.250
can lead to significant
rounding error

41
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.230
when multiplying small numbers,

42
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.625
which in turn can lead to

43
00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:01.720
instability in the estimate
of the probabilities.

44
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.060
Further, the multiplication
of probabilities turns

45
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.710
out to be an inefficient way

46
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.540
to perform the belief update.

47
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.435
So our basic application
of Bayes' rules to

48
00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:12.470
update beliefs over

49
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.310
the occupancy cells
is not looking good.

50
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.660
There is, however, a solution.

51
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.730
Instead of storing the belief map

52
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.965
with the values ranging from 0-1,

53
00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:23.840
we can convert our beliefs into

54
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.260
log odds probabilities
using the logit function.

55
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.010
We first saw this logit function
in course three.

56
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.555
This leads to cell values
ranging from negative infinity

57
00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:38.000
to positive infinity avoiding

58
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.580
the issue with numbers
close to zero.

59
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.790
The logit function takes
the natural logarithm of

60
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.970
the ratio of the
probability p and 1 minus

61
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.700
p. So it takes
probability values from

62
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.645
0-1 and maps them to
the entire real axis.

63
00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:56.480
It is also possible
to transition from

64
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.195
the log odds domain
back to probabilities.

65
00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:01.970
This is done by
taking the ratio of e

66
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.970
raised to the logit
of p divided by

67
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.090
1 plus e to the logit of p. We

68
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.250
now have an alternative
representation

69
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.885
for our cell probabilities.

70
00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:13.100
So let's see how this

71
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.395
affects our Bayesian
update equation.

72
00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.500
We will start this derivation
by the application of

73
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.195
Bayes' rule to p of
mi given y1 to t,

74
00:03:22.195 --> 00:03:25.310
where mi is the current
occupancy grid map square at

75
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.210
location i and y1 to t are
the sensor measurements of

76
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.270
that cell from time one
to time t. Writing out

77
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.480
the full Bayesian update
for incorporating

78
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.120
the latest measurements
into our occupancy belief,

79
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.950
we get the following equation.

80
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.810
The first term in
the numerator is

81
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.640
the probability of
getting measurement

82
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.930
yt given the cell state at
all previous measurements.

83
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.850
The second term in the numerator

84
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.320
is the probability a cell

85
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.550
is occupied given all
measurements to time t minus 1,

86
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.870
and the nominator is

87
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.790
the probability of
getting the measurements

88
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.605
yt given all previous measurements
up to time t minus 1.

89
00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:06.920
It should be noted that
the measurement yt is

90
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.360
separated from the rest of

91
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.225
the measurements of
y1 to t minus 1.

92
00:04:11.225 --> 00:04:13.115
This is done as we would like to

93
00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:14.885
update the occupancy grid with

94
00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:17.840
only the most recent sensor
measurement rather than

95
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.220
storing all measurements and

96
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.395
applying them again every time.

97
00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:25.070
Next, we will apply the Markov
assumption which ensures

98
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.200
the current measurement
is independent of

99
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.190
previous measurements if
the map state mi is known.

100
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.735
The next step is to expand
the measurement model p of y

101
00:04:35.735 --> 00:04:40.675
given mi by the application
of Bayes' rule once again.

102
00:04:40.675 --> 00:04:43.400
This results in
the probability of map cell

103
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.340
mi being the current
measurement multiplied by

104
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.340
the probability of getting
that measurement divided

105
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.025
by the probability of
grid cell mi is occupied.

106
00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:56.630
We now substitute the
expanded measurement model in

107
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.340
blue into the main Bayesian

108
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.440
inference equation shown here.

109
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.690
This leaves us with
three terms in

110
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.680
the numerator and two
terms in the denominator.

111
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.480
We will now pass
this expanded form through

112
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.280
the logit function and then start

113
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.545
simplifying the
resulting expression.

114
00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:14.870
Let's rearrange the term 1 minus

115
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.870
p before we write out
the resulting expression.

116
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.230
The denominator portion
of the log odds ratio

117
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.380
1 minus pmi given y1 to

118
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.170
t can be constructed by negating

119
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.165
the expression for
the probability

120
00:05:29.165 --> 00:05:30.815
of a cell being occupied,

121
00:05:30.815 --> 00:05:32.090
which is of course,

122
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.165
the probability that a grid
cell is not occupied.

123
00:05:35.165 --> 00:05:38.180
Next, we form the log odds ratio

124
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.800
which is simply the log of

125
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.885
the ratio of the
probability a cell is

126
00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:44.735
occupied to the
probability it is not.

127
00:05:44.735 --> 00:05:46.670
There are many like terms in

128
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.770
this expression which we can
now cancel out as follows.

129
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.500
We arrive at the following
simplified expression for

130
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.180
the odds ratio with

131
00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.125
only three terms each in
the numerator and denominator.

132
00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:02.630
We rewrite the expression in

133
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.165
the original 1 minus p notation.

134
00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:06.890
As you may have noticed,

135
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.055
this equation is better
viewed as three ratios.

136
00:06:10.055 --> 00:06:11.840
The ratio of the probabilities

137
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.225
to 1 minus the same probability.

138
00:06:14.225 --> 00:06:16.760
The first ratio is
the probability of

139
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.850
a cell being occupied
given a measurement y.

140
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.680
The second is the probability
a cell is not occupied,

141
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.360
and the third is
the prior belief that a cell is

142
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.440
occupied given all measurements
up to time t minus 1.

143
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.740
Finally, we apply
the log to our series of

144
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.660
probability ratios to arrive

145
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.000
at the addition of
three logit functions.

146
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.220
This is our final update equation

147
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.750
and has the nice property

148
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.960
of simply requiring addition

149
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.025
when a new measurement
is required.

150
00:06:46.025 --> 00:06:48.110
The three terms can be written in

151
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.850
a convenient shorthand
where lt minus

152
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.075
1i is the logit of the belief

153
00:06:53.075 --> 00:06:56.405
that cell i is occupied
at time t minus 1.

154
00:06:56.405 --> 00:07:01.310
Similarly, l0i at time
zero and lti at time

155
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.460
t. We now arrive at

156
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.590
the convenient log odds
update rule for

157
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.395
Bayesian inference on
occupancy grid maps.

158
00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:12.050
It is made up of
the three terms that are

159
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.640
combined at each time step

160
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.905
based on the latest
measurement data.

161
00:07:15.905 --> 00:07:20.060
The first term the logit
of the probability of mi

162
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.340
given yt is the logit

163
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.725
formed using new
measurement information.

164
00:07:24.725 --> 00:07:27.735
The probability
distribution p of mi

165
00:07:27.735 --> 00:07:32.015
given yt is known as
the inverse measurement model.

166
00:07:32.015 --> 00:07:34.100
We'll study how to do this in

167
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.850
the next video for LIDAR data.

168
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.260
Lt minus 1i is

169
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.815
the previous belief at
time t minus 1 for cell i,

170
00:07:42.815 --> 00:07:45.440
and l0i is the initial belief

171
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.585
at time zero for the same cell.

172
00:07:47.585 --> 00:07:49.519
The initial belief represents

173
00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:52.400
the baseline belief that
a grid cell is occupied,

174
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.550
which is usually set to
50 percent uniformly as we

175
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.500
don't expect to have
prior information

176
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.195
that improves on this value.

177
00:07:59.195 --> 00:08:02.300
It shows up in this equation
at every time step,

178
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.400
which is a bit surprising but is

179
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.560
simply a result of
the derivation that we

180
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.590
studied in this video and
adjusts the addition of

181
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.630
the first two terms to ensure

182
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.740
the updated belief is consistent
with the log odds form.

183
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.050
The Bayesian log odds has

184
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.790
two strong advantages over

185
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.920
directly updating probabilities.

186
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.250
The update is numerically
stable due to the logit mapping

187
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.855
of 01 probabilities to
the entire real axis,

188
00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:31.070
and computationally, it is also

189
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.990
significantly more efficient as

190
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.045
it relies exclusively on addition

191
00:08:35.045 --> 00:08:38.070
to complete all updates
of the occupancy grid.

192
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.435
Let's summarize what we
learned in this video.

193
00:08:41.435 --> 00:08:45.650
We first identified some issues
with storing and updating

194
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.180
the occupancy grid with

195
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.395
a straightforward Bayesian
probability update.

196
00:08:50.395 --> 00:08:53.960
We then saw how this issue
could be solved by

197
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.075
employing the log
odds representation

198
00:08:56.075 --> 00:08:57.950
of the probability space.

199
00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.900
Finally, we saw how

200
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.640
the Bayesian log odds update
is derived from Bayes' rule.

201
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.260
In the next video, we
will learn how to take

202
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.450
the Bayesian log odds
update and build

203
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.210
the required inverse
measurement model to update

204
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.800
the occupancy grid using

205
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.640
filtered 2D LIDAR data.
See you there.
