00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.920
Welcome everyone to
the second part of

2
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.615
our lesson on
Populating Occupancy Grid.

3
00:00:19.615 --> 00:00:23.070
In this video, we will
define the concept of

4
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.815
an inverse measurement model
and see how to build

5
00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:29.190
a simple inverse measurement
model for a lidar sensor.

6
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.170
We will also describe ray

7
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.320
tracing which will significantly

8
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.330
reduce computational
requirements for

9
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.450
the inverse measurement
model. Let's dive in.

10
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.660
Recall from the previous video
that in order to

11
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.930
perform the Bayesian update
of our occupancy grid,

12
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.635
we need to be able to evaluate
the log-odds update rule.

13
00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:53.240
To do this we need to compute
p of mi given yt which

14
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.650
represents the probability of

15
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.979
a cell mi in the occupancy
grid being occupied,

16
00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.005
given a certain measurement
yt is obtained by the lidar.

17
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.360
However, so far the measurement
models we have seen have

18
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.765
taken the form the probability
of yt given mi,

19
00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:11.060
which is in the mapping
case represents

20
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.045
the probability of getting
a certain lidar measurement,

21
00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:17.600
given a cell in the
occupancy grid is occupied.

22
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.610
So for occupancy grid updates,

23
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.370
we need to flip
this measurement model around.

24
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.635
That is, we have to construct

25
00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:26.480
an inverse measurement model that

26
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.160
constructs p of mi given

27
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.475
yt for every new
measurement received.

28
00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:33.860
As mentioned in
the first lesson of

29
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.020
this module, for simplicity sake,

30
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.180
we will only look at
the lidar data as

31
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.050
a 2D range data containing
two sets of information.

32
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.210
The bearing at
which each beam was

33
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.525
fired and the range
that the beam traveled.

34
00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:49.610
This is easily extended to

35
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.690
3D with the addition
of an elevation angle.

36
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.280
The bearing of each beam
is represented

37
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.560
by a set of angles Phi evenly

38
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.480
spaced within a range defined by

39
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.675
the minimum and maximum
viewing angles of the sensor.

40
00:02:02.675 --> 00:02:05.570
Typical rotating lidar
are able to capture

41
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.110
data in all directions
around the vehicle,

42
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.790
we'll assume the
available bearings in

43
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.180
this course will cover
all 360 degrees.

44
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.130
The range of each beam

45
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.440
corresponds to the distance
it has traveled

46
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.105
before impacting an object
represented by r1 to rJ.

47
00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:25.130
The range is measured between

48
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.655
minimum and maximum ranges
r min and r max,

49
00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:32.000
and we'll assume r min
is zero for simplicity.

50
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.100
Most lidar today will also
return a no echo signal,

51
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.810
if a particular beam
does not return an echo,

52
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.235
indicating the absence of

53
00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:43.165
any object within range
in that direction.

54
00:02:43.165 --> 00:02:45.175
As we proceed in this video,

55
00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:46.910
we will make
an assumption here that

56
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.520
the entire lidar scan
measurements from

57
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.575
a single rotation of the sensor

58
00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:54.680
is measured at
the same instant in time.

59
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.230
This is not an accurate
model for a vehicle

60
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.869
moving at speed with
a rotating lidar head,

61
00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:00.920
as we must actually

62
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.395
correct for the motion
of the vehicle,

63
00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:05.990
the correction can be
done using the state

64
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.390
estimates you developed
in course two,

65
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.800
and interpolating the motion

66
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.515
between these state
estimates as needed.

67
00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:14.540
So the inverse measurement model

68
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.415
will take the following form.

69
00:03:16.415 --> 00:03:18.350
Suppose this is the vehicle

70
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.150
with a lidar sensor collecting

71
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.279
range measurements at
different bearings

72
00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:24.680
in the following environment.

73
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.430
We construct a temporary
occupancy grid that

74
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.155
encompasses the maximum range

75
00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:32.120
of the beams in all directions.

76
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.970
The coordinate frame for
this measurement grid uses

77
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.270
the occupancy grid map frame
and so we define

78
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.330
a position x1 t and x2 t and an

79
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.460
orientation x3 t of

80
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.935
the sensor in
the occupancy grid frame.

81
00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:48.545
In practice, this
occupancy grid frame

82
00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:50.270
is set to the vehicle frame

83
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.175
and the map is transformed at

84
00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:55.145
each step based on
our state estimates.

85
00:03:55.145 --> 00:03:57.220
We're now ready to populate

86
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.780
the temporary measurement grid

87
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.940
with occupancy probabilities.

88
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.340
Based on the current lidar data,

89
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.480
we can define three

90
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.045
distinct areas of
the measurement grid.

91
00:04:07.045 --> 00:04:09.370
First, there is an area of

92
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.320
no information which none

93
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.555
of the lidar beams had
been able to reach.

94
00:04:13.555 --> 00:04:15.430
The current lidar scan provides

95
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.940
no new information about
the environment in this area.

96
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.705
Then there is an area with
low probability of an object,

97
00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:24.610
as all the beams
have passed through

98
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.875
this area without
encountering anything.

99
00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:29.980
Finally, there is an area

100
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.860
with high probability
of an object,

101
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.150
in which the lidar has
come into contact with

102
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.305
an object and has returned
a non maximum range value.

103
00:04:38.305 --> 00:04:42.100
To translate these areas
onto the measurement grid,

104
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.740
each grid square will
be assigned a range in

105
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.115
bearing relative to
the vehicles current location.

106
00:04:48.115 --> 00:04:51.070
The relative range of
each cell is simply

107
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.380
the Euclidean distance
from the sensor to

108
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.785
the cell, defined as follows,

109
00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:59.830
where ri is the range
to grid cell i and mxi

110
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.750
and myi are the x and y

111
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.325
coordinates of the center
of the grid cell.

112
00:05:04.325 --> 00:05:06.180
Finally, x1 t and

113
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.010
x2 t are the sensor location
at the current time

114
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.770
t. The relative bearing to

115
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.875
each cell is computed using
the tan inverse function.

116
00:05:14.875 --> 00:05:17.380
Here Phi identifies
the bearing to

117
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.790
the given cell in

118
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.410
reference to the sensor's
coordinate frame.

119
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.410
For each cell, we

120
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.870
associate the most
relevant lidar beam by

121
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.090
finding the measurement
with the minimum error

122
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.295
between its beam angle
and the cell bearing.

123
00:05:31.295 --> 00:05:35.085
We then define two parameters
Alpha and Beta,

124
00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:38.455
which define a sector
around each beam in which

125
00:05:38.455 --> 00:05:39.880
cell occupancy should be

126
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.115
determined based
on the beam range.

127
00:05:42.115 --> 00:05:45.670
This essentially creates
a region around each beam

128
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.885
which will get assigned

129
00:05:46.885 --> 00:05:50.065
the measurement information
of that particular beam.

130
00:05:50.065 --> 00:05:53.620
Alpha controls the range
cells at the range of

131
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.070
the beam which will be
tagged as high probability.

132
00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.460
Beta controls the angle
of the beam for which

133
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.090
cells will be marked as
either low or high probability.

134
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.085
We are now ready to assign

135
00:06:06.085 --> 00:06:08.935
a probability that
any cell is occupied

136
00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:11.185
given the lidar
measurements received

137
00:06:11.185 --> 00:06:14.575
based on these three
types of cells.

138
00:06:14.575 --> 00:06:17.515
The no information zone
corresponds to

139
00:06:17.515 --> 00:06:20.080
all cells with a greater range,

140
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.410
than the measured range
or outside the angle

141
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.025
Beta sized cone for the
measurements associated with it.

142
00:06:27.025 --> 00:06:30.790
We assign a probability
of an obstacle equal to

143
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.800
the prior probability
of a cell being

144
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.145
occupied which is usually 0.5.

145
00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:38.530
The high information zone defines

146
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.200
cells that fall within
Alpha over two of

147
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.630
the range measurement
and within Beta over

148
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.165
two of the angle of the
measurement associated with it.

149
00:06:47.165 --> 00:06:50.150
We assign an occupied
probability of

150
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.240
greater than 0.5. to these cells.

151
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.880
Finally, the low
information zone is

152
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.730
defined by cells that
have a range less than

153
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.770
the measured range minus
Alpha over two and

154
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.225
lie within the Beta sized
cone about the measurement.

155
00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:07.640
We assign an occupied
probability of

156
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.550
less than 0.5 to these cells.

157
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.465
For example, let's say
a lidar scan returns

158
00:07:14.465 --> 00:07:18.545
a range to an object at
the location marked by a red X.

159
00:07:18.545 --> 00:07:21.020
The affected area which
will be tagged as

160
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.500
high probability is given in red.

161
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.690
Increasing the value of Alpha
will increase the range of

162
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.120
the affected region and
increasing the value of

163
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.985
Beta affects the angle
of the affected region.

164
00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:33.470
We can now construct

165
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.270
the full inverse
measurement model to

166
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.750
be used in our log-odds update.

167
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.745
However, this simple
inverse measurement model

168
00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:42.980
can be computationally expensive.

169
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.170
It requires a full update

170
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.480
of every cell in
the measurement map,

171
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.330
and relies on multiple
floating-point operations

172
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.170
to identify which measurements
correspond to which cells.

173
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.800
An alternative, is to use
a ray tracing algorithm,

174
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.020
such as the computer
science classic,

175
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.900
the Bresenham's line algorithm.

176
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.610
Bresenham's line algorithm
was originally

177
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.700
designed in the early 1960's
to efficiently

178
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.130
solve the line
plotting problem for

179
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.840
displays and printing on

180
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.045
the available hardware
of the day.

181
00:08:14.045 --> 00:08:17.990
By ray tracing along
the beams of the lidar scan,

182
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.850
we reduce the number
of cells that need to

183
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.890
be processed and identify them

184
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.280
more quickly relying on
integer addition subtraction and

185
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.080
bit shifting to move through

186
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.360
the grid along the lidar beams.

187
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.230
Interestingly, many beams go
through the same cells near

188
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.180
the car greatly increasing

189
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.835
the confidence in
measurements nearby.

190
00:08:37.835 --> 00:08:40.220
This concludes our discussion of

191
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.720
the inverse measurement model for

192
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.975
log odds occupancy grid mapping.

193
00:08:43.975 --> 00:08:45.515
Let's summarize.

194
00:08:45.515 --> 00:08:47.945
In this video, we constructed

195
00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:50.210
a simple inverse
measurement model for

196
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.885
lidar data needed in
the log-odds update step.

197
00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:55.670
We also briefly covered

198
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.560
a potential improvement by using

199
00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.245
ray tracing to
speed computations.

200
00:09:00.245 --> 00:09:01.790
In our next video,

201
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.475
we will look into the many steps
needed to prepare

202
00:09:04.475 --> 00:09:06.770
a 3D lidar scan to be used

203
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.290
for occupancy grid mapping.
See you there.
