00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.635
Welcome. In this lesson,

2
00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:19.545
we will build on Dijkstra's
algorithm by introducing

3
00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:22.005
a new potentially faster approach

4
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.660
that we can use for our
mission planning problem.

5
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.430
To do this, we'll leverage
heuristics in our search,

6
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.780
which will help us refine

7
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.210
the search process to
make it more efficient.

8
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.130
By the end of this video,

9
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.320
you should understand the role of

10
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.420
heuristics in graph search and

11
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.280
identify which heuristics are

12
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.030
valid for our mission planning
problem and which are not.

13
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.715
You should also be
able to leverage

14
00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:48.940
heuristics in
our graph search problem,

15
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.550
by using the A* search algorithm,

16
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.830
and recognize how
to apply A* search

17
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.930
to variance of the
mission planning problem

18
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.430
we've discussed so far.

19
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.410
So let's get started.

20
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.870
If you recall from
the last lesson we

21
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.210
introduced Dijkstra's
algorithm to help

22
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.205
us tackle the
mission planning problem

23
00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:09.860
for the case of
a weighted graph edges,

24
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.570
which was more realistic than

25
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.390
our previous unweighted
graph instance because it

26
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.575
let us take into account

27
00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:19.385
variable distances across
different road segments.

28
00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:22.760
However, Dijkstra's
algorithm required us to

29
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.000
search almost all of the edges
present in the graph,

30
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.040
even though only a
few of them were

31
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.450
actually useful for
constructing the optimal path.

32
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.820
Well, this wasn't a problem
for our small example graph.

33
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.950
It will cause issues
when we scale

34
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.350
our problem to
more realistic proportions,

35
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.280
such as a full road
network for a city.

36
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.780
To improve our
efficiency in practice,

37
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.110
we can instead rely on
a search heuristic by using

38
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.150
the A* algorithm to find

39
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.895
our destination rather
than Dijkstra's.

40
00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:55.055
What is a search heuristic?

41
00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:58.670
In this context, a search
heuristic is an estimate of

42
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.710
the remaining cost to reach

43
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.270
the destination vertex from

44
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.460
any given vertex in the graph.

45
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.370
Of course, any heuristic
we use won't be

46
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.350
exact as that would require

47
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.210
knowing the answer to
our search problem already.

48
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.410
Instead, we rely on
the structure of

49
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.525
the problem instance to develop

50
00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:20.795
a reasonable estimate
that is fast to compute.

51
00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:22.760
In our case, the vertices in

52
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.625
the graph correspond
to points in space,

53
00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:27.380
with the edges corresponding

54
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.120
to segments of a road which have

55
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.950
a weight corresponding to

56
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.035
the length of those
road segments.

57
00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:37.280
Therefore a useful estimate
on the cost or length between

58
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.050
any two vertices is

59
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.070
the straight line or Euclidean
distance between them,

60
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.210
as shown here by HOV,

61
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.640
for a given vertex v
and goal t. Therefore,

62
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.484
for any vertex we
encounter in our search,

63
00:02:51.484 --> 00:02:53.570
our estimate for
the remaining cost

64
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.100
to the goal vertex will

65
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.840
just be the Euclidean distance

66
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.435
between that vertex and the goal.

67
00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:01.880
Note that this estimate is always

68
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.660
an underestimate of the true
distance to reach the goal,

69
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.505
since the shortest path between

70
00:03:07.505 --> 00:03:09.640
any two points is
a straight line.

71
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.100
This is an important
requirement for A* search,

72
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.930
and heuristics that satisfy

73
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.545
this requirement are called
admissible heuristics.

74
00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:20.750
As an example calculation,

75
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.660
suppose we have a start
vertex a and a goal

76
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.935
vertex c. Vertex a
corresponds to the 0.0,

77
00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:30.820
and vertex b corresponds to 2.0.

78
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.395
Vertex c in this case
corresponds to 2.2.

79
00:03:34.395 --> 00:03:36.860
Therefore, the Euclidean distance

80
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.350
between a and c is 2.828,

81
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.120
which is our heuristic estimate
of the cost to the goal.

82
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.460
Note that the edge cost between

83
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.785
any two adjacent vertices is not

84
00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:51.580
equal to the distance
between those vertices.

85
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.315
This is because road segments

86
00:03:53.315 --> 00:03:55.040
are not straight line paths,

87
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.530
and in general
the road segment length will

88
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.310
be influenced by
the shape of the road.

89
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.365
Because of the graphs simplicity,

90
00:04:02.365 --> 00:04:04.250
we can see that the actual cost

91
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.010
of the path from a to c is 4.6,

92
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.690
by summing up
the ab and bc edge costs.

93
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.934
As expected, our heuristic

94
00:04:12.934 --> 00:04:15.890
is an underestimate
of the true cost.

95
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.500
Let's use this new heuristic

96
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.945
to better inform
our graph search.

97
00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:24.160
Here, we have the pseudocode
for the A* algorithm.

98
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.790
It's largely the same as
Dijkstra's algorithm,

99
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.155
but it has a few key differences,

100
00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:31.220
which we've highlighted in blue.

101
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.290
Let's look more closely
at the specific changes.

102
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.885
Recall that in
Dijkstra's algorithm,

103
00:04:37.885 --> 00:04:40.130
we push our open vertices onto

104
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.840
a min heap along with

105
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.525
their accumulated
cost from the origin.

106
00:04:44.525 --> 00:04:46.550
The main heap then sorts

107
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.845
the open vertices by their
associated accumulated cost.

108
00:04:50.845 --> 00:04:54.135
The min difference between
Dijkstra's algorithm

109
00:04:54.135 --> 00:04:58.640
and A* is that instead of
using the accumulated cost,

110
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.915
we use the accumulated
cost plus hv,

111
00:05:01.915 --> 00:05:04.970
the heuristic estimated
remaining cost to

112
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.990
the goal vertex as the value
we push onto the min heap.

113
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.780
The min heap then
essentially sorts

114
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.430
the open vertices by

115
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.565
the estimated total
cost to the goal.

116
00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:19.280
In this sense, A* biases

117
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.080
the search towards
vertices that are

118
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.370
likely to be part of

119
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.595
the optimal path according
to our search heuristic.

120
00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:28.040
Since we are storing a heuristic

121
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.475
based total cost
and the min-heap,

122
00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:32.450
we also need to keep track of

123
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.060
the true cost of
each vertex as well,

124
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.015
which we store in
the cost structure.

125
00:05:38.015 --> 00:05:40.400
An interesting thing to note

126
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.470
is that if we take
our heuristic to be

127
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.270
zero for all vertices

128
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.595
which is still
an admissible heuristic,

129
00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:49.400
we then end up with
Dijkstra's algorithm.

130
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.100
As before with
Dijkstra's algorithm,

131
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.395
we will add the origin
to the min heap,

132
00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:56.960
then pop each vertex
off of the heap and

133
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.600
add all adjacent
vertices to the heap,

134
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.060
until we process the goal vertex.

135
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.020
Let's apply the A* algorithm
to our example graph.

136
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.450
Here we have
our road network graph

137
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.890
from the previous lessons,

138
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.000
except now we've added

139
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.355
the actual position
of each vertex.

140
00:06:13.355 --> 00:06:15.620
Note that the figure
is not to scale

141
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.705
and the vertices
are nicely spaced

142
00:06:17.705 --> 00:06:19.760
to make the figure
more legible instead

143
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.430
of being depicted
in Euclidean space.

144
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.430
However, you can see that
the edge length between

145
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.800
any two adjacent vertices are at

146
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.820
least as long as
their Euclidean distance.

147
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.320
As always, the first vertex

148
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.390
we add to the min heap
is the origin

149
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.900
s. There is zero accumulated cost

150
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.055
and the Euclidean
distance between s and t,

151
00:06:42.055 --> 00:06:43.580
which is a lower bound on

152
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.020
our shortest path
distance is 4.472.

153
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.390
So we add vertex s
with cost 4.472.

154
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.840
Next, we process the first node s

155
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.220
and add the adjacent vertices a,

156
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.440
b, and c to the min heap.

157
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.860
Remember that we need to
add the accumulated cost to

158
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.645
the heuristic cost to the goal

159
00:07:05.645 --> 00:07:08.360
when adding each vertex
to the min heap.

160
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.820
Thus for vertex a,

161
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.630
we have a cost of 5 plus 3 is 8.

162
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.385
For vertex b, we have
a cost of 7 plus 2 is nine,

163
00:07:17.385 --> 00:07:20.130
and for vertex c we
have a cost of 2 plus

164
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.690
the square root of
9 plus 4 is 5.6.

165
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.540
The order of the vertices
in the min heap is now cab.

166
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.600
We also add s as the predecessor
to the vertices a,

167
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.260
b, and c and then add
s to the closed set.

168
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.200
The next vertex to process is c,

169
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.025
which only connects to vertex e.

170
00:07:42.025 --> 00:07:45.720
The cost of e works out to 11.4.

171
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.580
So we now have
a vertex order abe.

172
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.880
We then assign e's predecessor to

173
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.470
be c and add c to the closed set.

174
00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.895
Next, we pop a off of the min
heap and we see that it has

175
00:08:00.895 --> 00:08:05.950
outgoing edges to vertex b
and d. The cost to b eight,

176
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.590
which is lower than the
original estimated cost for b.

177
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.800
So we update its cost
in a min heap and

178
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.700
change its predecessor
from s to a.

179
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.870
To show we've updated its cost,

180
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.045
we've highlighted
the edge in purple.

181
00:08:19.045 --> 00:08:23.995
We also add vertex d to
the min heap with cost of seven.

182
00:08:23.995 --> 00:08:27.625
The new heap ordering
is thus dbe.

183
00:08:27.625 --> 00:08:30.280
We then assign a to
be the predecessor of

184
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.650
d and add a to the closed set.

185
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.075
The process continues with d,

186
00:08:36.075 --> 00:08:38.400
which has outgoing edges to e and

187
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.095
t. The estimated cost
of e is 15.4.

188
00:08:42.095 --> 00:08:43.670
Since this is higher than

189
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.710
e's current cost in the min heap,

190
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.180
we ignore this new path

191
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.235
to e and as such we
mark this edge and red.

192
00:08:50.235 --> 00:08:52.785
The estimated cost of t is seven.

193
00:08:52.785 --> 00:08:54.540
Since it is the goal node it has

194
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.015
zero heuristic cost to goal.

195
00:08:57.015 --> 00:09:01.620
After doing this,
the new min heap ordering is t b

196
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.100
e. We set the predecessor of t to

197
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.740
be d and add a to the closed set.

198
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.665
Finally, we process the vertex t

199
00:09:09.665 --> 00:09:12.825
which is the goal
vertex. So we are done.

200
00:09:12.825 --> 00:09:15.060
The final shortest path from s

201
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.300
to t is shown on this graph here,

202
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.660
and we are able to avoid
processing both b and d,

203
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.915
thanks to the A* approach.

204
00:09:22.915 --> 00:09:25.910
Unfortunately, this
example graph is

205
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:26.990
quite small in order to

206
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.700
demonstrate how
the algorithm works.

207
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.320
However, as we scale

208
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.740
the problem to
much larger graph inputs,

209
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.400
we will see that the heuristic

210
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.470
used in the A* algorithm will

211
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:37.520
cause it to explore

212
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.580
far fewer vertices than
the Dijkstra's algorithm.

213
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.614
Asymptotically, A* will never
do worse than Dijkstra's,

214
00:09:44.614 --> 00:09:46.970
and in practice A* will result

215
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.185
in a much faster
mission planning process.

216
00:09:50.185 --> 00:09:52.440
Now, in our examples,

217
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.500
we've simplified the
mission planning problems

218
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.940
such that the edge weights or

219
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.850
the distance along
road segments in the map.

220
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.055
However, if we were to include

221
00:10:01.055 --> 00:10:04.230
other factors such as
traffic, speed limits,

222
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.435
or weather into our
mission planning problem,

223
00:10:06.435 --> 00:10:09.260
the road distance along
the path would be too

224
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.425
simplistic to capture
the scope of the problem.

225
00:10:12.425 --> 00:10:14.780
To remedy this, we
can instead take

226
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.850
the estimated time to cross

227
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.190
the road segment as
our edge weights,

228
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.750
and this takes all of

229
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.195
the mentioned factors
into consideration.

230
00:10:23.195 --> 00:10:25.010
However, this renders

231
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.800
our Euclidean distance
metric useless,

232
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.210
as it no longer captures

233
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.210
the true cost to the goal
in terms of time.

234
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.265
To remedy this, we can use

235
00:10:34.265 --> 00:10:37.745
a lower bound estimate of
the time to the goal point

236
00:10:37.745 --> 00:10:39.770
as a Euclidean
distance divided by

237
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.655
the maximum speed allowed
across all road segments.

238
00:10:43.655 --> 00:10:46.280
The car should not
exceed the speed limit.

239
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.280
So even in ideal traffic
and weather conditions,

240
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.895
as well as a straight
line path to the goal,

241
00:10:51.895 --> 00:10:54.020
this is the absolute
shortest amount of

242
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.810
time the car can
travel to that goal.

243
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.090
This means it is a lower bound on

244
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.265
the true cost to
the goal at all times,

245
00:11:01.265 --> 00:11:04.940
and as such it is
an admissible heuristic.

246
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.115
For example, here we have set

247
00:11:07.115 --> 00:11:10.009
our maximum speed to be
a 100 kilometers per hour,

248
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:12.230
with the edge weights
corresponding to the number

249
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.795
of seconds it takes
to traverse a path.

250
00:11:14.795 --> 00:11:19.610
After computing our heuristic
value of a 101.8 seconds,

251
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.590
we can see that it
is much lower than

252
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.260
the true path length from a to c,

253
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.095
which is a 165.6 seconds.

254
00:11:27.095 --> 00:11:28.999
This is because in general,

255
00:11:28.999 --> 00:11:31.820
this heuristic is a
poor lower bound as

256
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.120
the segments will often take
much longer to traverse,

257
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.680
than the computed minimum.

258
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.150
Poor lower bounds can

259
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.550
degrade the ability
of our heuristic to

260
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.435
guide our search to the goal
for more complex problems,

261
00:11:44.435 --> 00:11:47.210
as compared to
problem instances that

262
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.645
were strictly focused
on minimizing distance.

263
00:11:50.645 --> 00:11:53.720
More advanced methods
are available which

264
00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.660
pre-compute additional
values and consider

265
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.840
modified heuristic definitions
that allow large networks

266
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.700
with time-based travel estimates

267
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.380
to be searched efficiently.

268
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.440
We've included some links in
the supplemental material,

269
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.975
if you're interested
in learning more.

270
00:12:08.975 --> 00:12:12.080
In this video, we
introduced the concept of

271
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.810
the Euclidean heuristic
and showed that it was

272
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.095
an admissible heuristic for
our motion planning problem.

273
00:12:18.095 --> 00:12:20.690
We then used it in
our implementation of

274
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.540
A* search for
a motion planning problem.

275
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.090
We also discussed how to modify

276
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.030
the mission planning problem
we've discussed so far,

277
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.290
to include travel times
instead of road lengths,

278
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.190
and also how to modify

279
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.640
our search heuristic to be
admissible in this situation.

280
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.510
Congratulations.

281
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.620
You've reached the end of

282
00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.735
this module on mission planning.

283
00:12:44.735 --> 00:12:47.460
In this module, you
learned to define

284
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.980
the mission planning problem as

285
00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.905
a shortest path search
over a directed graph,

286
00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:54.035
and you applied Dijkstra's and

287
00:12:54.035 --> 00:12:57.530
A* algorithms to find
the shortest path efficiently.

288
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.240
In the next module,

289
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.785
you'll learn about dynamic

290
00:13:00.785 --> 00:13:02.840
object interactions and how these

291
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.655
relate to the second stage

292
00:13:04.655 --> 00:13:06.620
of our motion planning hierarchy,

293
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.970
the behavioral planner.
See you there.
