00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.950
Hi everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.795
the first lesson of week three.

3
00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.700
In this module,
we'll be discussing

4
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.260
the mission planning problem in

5
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.840
autonomous driving
and how to solve it.

6
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.940
If you recall from Module 1,

7
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.605
the autonomous driving mission

8
00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:35.270
is the highest level portion of

9
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.970
our motion planning task
and it's crucial

10
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.225
for navigating the autonomous
car to its destination.

11
00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:44.930
In this video, we'll introduce
the mathematical concept

12
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.485
of a graph and how it can be
used in our mission planner.

13
00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:51.590
In addition, we will discuss
how a graph can be used to

14
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.270
represent the road network that

15
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.325
we are required to
navigate through.

16
00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:57.020
Finally, we'll discuss

17
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.300
the Breadth-First Search
algorithm and

18
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.440
how it can be applied to

19
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.800
mission planning.
Let's get started.

20
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.540
First, let's recall
the autonomous driving mission.

21
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.070
The objective of the autonomous

22
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.510
driving mission is to find

23
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.830
the optimal path for

24
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.620
the eagle vehicle from
its current position to

25
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.020
a given destination by navigating

26
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.570
the road network while
abstracting away

27
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.640
the lower-level details
like the rules of

28
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.290
the road and other agents

29
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.435
present in the driving scenario.

30
00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:29.290
In this module, we will think
of optimality in terms of

31
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.210
the amount of time or distance it

32
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.850
takes for the car to
reach its destination.

33
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.445
For autonomous driving,
mission planning

34
00:01:36.445 --> 00:01:39.085
is considered the highest
level planning problem.

35
00:01:39.085 --> 00:01:41.560
This is because
the spatial planning scale

36
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.195
of the mission planner is
on the order of kilometers

37
00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:46.390
and the mission planner
doesn't focus on

38
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.100
low-level planning
constraints such

39
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.560
as obstacles or dynamics.

40
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.665
Instead, the mission
planner will focus on

41
00:01:53.665 --> 00:01:56.380
aspects of the road
network when planning,

42
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.035
such as speed limits
and road lengths,

43
00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:01.930
traffic flow rates
and road closures.

44
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.930
Based on these constraints
posed to us by the map,

45
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.030
the mission planner needs to find

46
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.030
the optimal path to
our required destination.

47
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.890
One thing to note about

48
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.690
the road network is
that it is highly

49
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.730
structured which is
something we can

50
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.045
exploit in our planning process
to simplify the problem.

51
00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:20.890
By exploiting the structure,

52
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.350
we can efficiently find
the optimal path to

53
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.710
our destination based
on the map given to us.

54
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.580
To do this, we will need to use

55
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.160
a mathematical structure
known as a graph,

56
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.085
which we've overlaid onto
our road network here.

57
00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:35.895
So what is a graph?

58
00:02:35.895 --> 00:02:38.150
A graph is a discrete structure

59
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.550
composed of a set of
vertices denoted as

60
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.995
V and a set of edges denoted

61
00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:45.505
as E. For the mission planner,

62
00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:47.120
each vertex in V will

63
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.030
correspond to a given
point on the road network,

64
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.430
and each edge E
will correspond to

65
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.095
the road segment that connects

66
00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:56.420
any two points in
the road network.

67
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.850
In this sense, a sequence

68
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.980
of contiguous edges in the graph

69
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.960
corresponds to a path through

70
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.975
the road network from
one point to another.

71
00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:08.585
An example of a
graph is shown here.

72
00:03:08.585 --> 00:03:10.565
For now, we will assume

73
00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:12.730
each road segment
is of equal length,

74
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.190
so the edges of this
graph are all unweighted.

75
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.960
However, in future lessons,

76
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.140
we will relax this restriction.

77
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.855
To generate a graph such as this,

78
00:03:22.855 --> 00:03:25.730
the road network needs to
be discreetly sampled,

79
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.460
which will give us
the vertices of our graph.

80
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.870
The edges will then be

81
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.790
defined by the
segments of the road

82
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.620
that connect each sample point

83
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.495
according to the rules
of the road.

84
00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:37.305
Note that in general,

85
00:03:37.305 --> 00:03:39.200
just because point A is

86
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.990
adjacent to point B
using a road segment,

87
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.090
it does not mean
that point A can be

88
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.080
reached from point B from
that same road segment.

89
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.220
This is because in
many cases there is

90
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.540
only one direction that

91
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.315
a road segment can be
legally traversed.

92
00:03:53.315 --> 00:03:57.050
In this sense, the edges
of our graph are directed

93
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.865
in that the edge is only
traversable in one direction.

94
00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:03.260
We've denoted this
by using arrows for

95
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.920
our edges in the graph to
display their directionality.

96
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.740
Now that we have
are directed graph,

97
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.880
how do we find an optimal path
to our destination?

98
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.160
First, we locate the vertices
in the graph that

99
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.940
correspond to our current eagle
vehicle position which we

100
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.860
will denote as S and

101
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.780
our desired destination
which we will

102
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.810
denote as t. These two vertices

103
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.940
are shown on the graph here.

104
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.475
Once we have these two vertices,

105
00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:34.310
we can use an efficient
graph search algorithm to

106
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.655
find the optimal or shortest
path to our destination.

107
00:04:37.655 --> 00:04:40.940
Since our graph formulation
is currently unweighted,

108
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.860
a good candidate algorithm is

109
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.850
the Breadth-First Search or BFS.

110
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.230
At a high level,
BFS can be thought

111
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.120
of as iterating through all of

112
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.950
the vertices in the graph but

113
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.065
doing so in a manner such that

114
00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:56.990
all adjacent vertices
are evaluated

115
00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.965
first before proceeding
deeper into the graph.

116
00:05:00.965 --> 00:05:04.280
In this sense, the graph
search proceeds like

117
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.180
a moving wavefront through
the graph or breadth-first.

118
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.395
Let's walk through the steps
of the BFS algorithm.

119
00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:15.200
We construct three data
structures to aid in

120
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.165
our search and open queue

121
00:05:17.165 --> 00:05:19.565
of vertices still to be assessed,

122
00:05:19.565 --> 00:05:21.530
a closed set of vertices that

123
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.870
have been assessed by
the search algorithm

124
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.340
and a dictionary of

125
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.985
predecessors which store
the results of the search.

126
00:05:28.985 --> 00:05:32.680
A queue is a first-in-first-out
data structure,

127
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.900
such that the first
vertex pushed or added to

128
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.730
the queue is the first one

129
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.445
popped off or returned
from the queue.

130
00:05:40.445 --> 00:05:42.980
A dictionary is
an unordered set of

131
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.670
key-value pairs and for
each node in the closed set,

132
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.890
stores a predecessor vertex

133
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.250
that will identify momentarily.

134
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.750
The algorithm starts
by adding our

135
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.090
start vertex to the open queue.

136
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.330
Then, while the open queue
contains vertices,

137
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.160
we take the first element from

138
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.340
the open queue and check if
it is the goal location.

139
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.385
If so, we found
our shortest path.

140
00:06:07.385 --> 00:06:11.090
If not, we then add
all adjacent vertices not

141
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.100
already in the open queue or

142
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.455
closed set to the open queue.

143
00:06:15.455 --> 00:06:17.450
This prevents us from getting

144
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.360
stuck in cycles during
the graph search.

145
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.550
Note that by adjacent,

146
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.320
we mean all vertices that can

147
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.720
be reached from
the current vertex.

148
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.275
Because we use a queue
to store open vertices,

149
00:06:30.275 --> 00:06:32.945
we ensure that
all adjacent vertices

150
00:06:32.945 --> 00:06:34.130
at the current depth in

151
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.630
the search are processed

152
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.315
before proceeding
deeper into the graph.

153
00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:40.190
So all vertices that are

154
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.110
one step away from
the start vertex

155
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.670
will be processed before moving

156
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.400
on to vertices that
are two steps away.

157
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.849
As a vertex is added
to the open queue,

158
00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:51.980
we store its preceding vertex

159
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.885
in the predecessor dictionary.

160
00:06:53.885 --> 00:06:55.790
This will help us reconstruct

161
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.005
the optimal path once
the goal is found.

162
00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:02.630
Finally, we add
the currently active vertex to

163
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.790
the closed set and return to

164
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.015
the next element of
the open queue to process.

165
00:07:08.015 --> 00:07:11.959
Because of the breadth-first
nature of the BFS algorithm,

166
00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:14.590
by the time we reach
the goal vertex,

167
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.320
we have processed all possible
predecessor vertices of

168
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.780
the golden vertex
that are closer to

169
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.800
the start vertex
then the goal vertex.

170
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.920
This means that when we
reach the goal vertex,

171
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.420
we have found the
shortest path to the goal

172
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.060
vertex and we can
terminate the algorithm.

173
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.380
To solidify our understanding
of this algorithm,

174
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.350
let's work through
a concrete example.

175
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.140
Suppose our mission
planner needs to

176
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.570
find the optimal path
from point s to

177
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.910
our destination t
through the set of

178
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.910
vertices in our graph
which are now labeled,

179
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.000
the first step would be
to process the origin

180
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.210
s and add all
adjacent vertices to

181
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.510
our queue and set
their predecessors to

182
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.210
s. The outgoing edges that

183
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.570
lead to the adjacent vertices
are highlighted in blue.

184
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.990
Once we've added
these to our queue,

185
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.115
we then add s to our closed list.

186
00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:13.890
Next, we pop off vertex a.

187
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.685
The outgoing edges of
a lead to d and b,

188
00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:20.115
but b is already in
our queue, thus,

189
00:08:20.115 --> 00:08:24.745
we only add d to the queue and
mark a as its predecessor.

190
00:08:24.745 --> 00:08:28.040
We've highlighted
this duplicate path to be in

191
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.910
red to show that we do not
add b to the queue twice.

192
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.520
We've now processed
all adjacent edges

193
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.525
from a and move it
to the closed set.

194
00:08:37.525 --> 00:08:39.870
We repeat the same process for

195
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.810
b which adds E to
the queue with b as

196
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.710
its predecessor and c which has

197
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.750
no new adjacent vertices so

198
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.485
does not add vertices
to the open queue.

199
00:08:50.485 --> 00:08:53.160
Next, we process
d from the queue,

200
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.920
which only adds t
to the queue with

201
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.475
d as its predecessor since
e has already been added.

202
00:08:59.475 --> 00:09:01.140
When e is popped off,

203
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.370
it doesn't add c or d to
the queue because both of

204
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.630
these vertices have already been

205
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.140
processed and are present
in the closed set.

206
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.800
Finally, we pop off
t from the queue.

207
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.500
This is our goal vertex.

208
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.470
So we now reconstruct the path
from s to t by following

209
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.600
the chain of predecessors from t

210
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.390
back to s. Once this is done,

211
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.975
we've found the optimal path
to our destination,

212
00:09:25.975 --> 00:09:28.300
which is highlighted in green.

213
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.380
The sequence of edges

214
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.450
corresponding to
our optimal path in

215
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.160
the graph can be turned into

216
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.070
a root over the road
network using our map,

217
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.930
which can then be used to govern

218
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.850
more detailed motion planning in

219
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.730
the subsequent layers of
our planning hierarchy.

220
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.145
Before we wrap up this video,

221
00:09:46.145 --> 00:09:48.020
we should note that there is also

222
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.995
the highly related
Depth-First Search algorithm

223
00:09:50.995 --> 00:09:52.365
among many others.

224
00:09:52.365 --> 00:09:55.070
Depth-First Search
uses a last-in,

225
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.865
first-out stack instead of
a queue for the open set.

226
00:09:58.865 --> 00:10:00.350
This change means that

227
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.510
the most recently added vertex is

228
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.900
evaluated instead of the oldest.

229
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.440
The result is a search that

230
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.240
quickly moves deeper in the graph

231
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.890
and then eventually backtracks

232
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.325
to vertices added much earlier.

233
00:10:12.325 --> 00:10:14.810
From this video, you should have

234
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.960
an understanding of the mission
planning problem and

235
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.330
how we construct
and use graphs as

236
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.450
a map level representation
of our planning domain.

237
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.020
In addition, you should now
be comfortable with using

238
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.180
Breadth-First Search to navigate

239
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.830
an unweighted graph to find

240
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.410
the shortest path to
a given destination.

241
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.195
In our next lesson,

242
00:10:35.195 --> 00:10:37.760
we're going to make the
graph more complex by

243
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.430
adding different weights
to the edges in our graph,

244
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.560
to better reflect
the different costs for

245
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.050
using different road
segments and we'll

246
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.690
introduce Dykstra's
algorithm a method for

247
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.730
handling this new complexity.
See you next time.
