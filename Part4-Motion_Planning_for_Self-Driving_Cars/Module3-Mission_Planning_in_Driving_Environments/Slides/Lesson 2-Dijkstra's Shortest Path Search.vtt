00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.725
Welcome to the second lesson

2
00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.465
in the mission planning module.

3
00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:21.840
In this lesson we'll modify
our unweighted graph,

4
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.185
from the previous lesson
to contain edge weights.

5
00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:27.570
To give a more applicable
representation

6
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.055
for our mission planning problem.

7
00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:31.710
We'll then discuss how it
impacts our algorithm,

8
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.990
and how we can overcome

9
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.735
this challenge while still
planning efficiently.

10
00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:38.540
In particular by the
end of this video,

11
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.010
you should be able to understand

12
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.705
the difference between
weighted and unweighted graphs,

13
00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:44.180
and why weighted graphs are

14
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.860
more useful for mission planning.

15
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.145
You should have a firm grasp
of the Dijkstra's algorithm.

16
00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:53.450
A graph search algorithm
that is useful for

17
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.560
weighted graphs.
Let's get started.

18
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.030
As a refresher, recall that

19
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.800
for our mission planning problem,

20
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.290
the goal is to find
the optimal path in

21
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.590
our road network from the ego
vehicles current position,

22
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.870
to the required
final destination.

23
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.970
In the last video
we presented the

24
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.030
breadth-first search algorithm
to solve this problem.

25
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.645
However, in the process
we assume that

26
00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:19.075
all road segments
have equal length,

27
00:01:19.075 --> 00:01:21.575
which is an overly
simplistic assumption.

28
00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:23.370
Depending on factors such as

29
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.680
road lengths, traffic,
speed limits,

30
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.730
and weather, different
road segments

31
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.415
can vary wildly in
their traversal costs.

32
00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:32.800
For simplicity, we
will initially focus

33
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.095
purely on distance
in our search graph.

34
00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.920
To reflect this, we will add

35
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.230
edge weights to
each edge in the graph,

36
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.895
that correspond to the length

37
00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:45.175
of the corresponding
road segment.

38
00:01:45.175 --> 00:01:46.810
This is shown here,

39
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.985
after updating
our unweighted graph

40
00:01:48.985 --> 00:01:51.115
with appropriate edge weights.

41
00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:53.560
The units of the weights
are arbitrary,

42
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.275
as long as they are
common to all edges.

43
00:01:56.275 --> 00:01:58.220
For this instance, suppose

44
00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.900
the edge weights
are the number of

45
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.485
kilometers it takes to travel
across that road segment.

46
00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:05.600
As before, the goal is to

47
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.970
find the optimal path
from the vertex of

48
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.610
the ego vehicles
current position S to

49
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.935
the final destination
vertex T. Unfortunately,

50
00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:16.730
our BFS algorithm doesn't

51
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.770
take edge weights
into consideration.

52
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.510
So it isn't guaranteed to find

53
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.715
the optimal path
in this situation.

54
00:02:22.715 --> 00:02:24.365
We instead need to use

55
00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:26.210
a different more
powerful algorithm.

56
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.960
This is where Dijkstra's
algorithm comes in.

57
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.230
Edsger Dijkstra, a Dutch
computer scientist,

58
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.110
first conceived of
this algorithm in 1956.

59
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.585
In an interview in 2001,

60
00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:39.740
he explains that he was

61
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.780
shopping with
his fiance at the time,

62
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.405
and got tired and they
sat down for a coffee.

63
00:02:44.405 --> 00:02:46.190
He had been puzzling
with the shortest

64
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.780
path problem in his head,

65
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.790
and within 20 minutes
he worked out

66
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.100
his algorithm without
pen or paper.

67
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.840
It took him three more years to

68
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.610
write a paper on this topic,

69
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.950
but he credits the simplicity
and elegance of

70
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.840
the idea with being forced to

71
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.825
work through the solution
entirely in his head.

72
00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:05.660
The overall flow of
Dijkstra's algorithm

73
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.895
is quite similar to BFS.

74
00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:09.470
The main difference is in

75
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.855
the order we process
the vertices.

76
00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:13.730
We've highlighted
the differences from

77
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.995
the BFS algorithm in blue.

78
00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:19.220
As before, we keep track
of the vertices we

79
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.040
have already processed
in the closed set,

80
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.870
and the vertices
we've discovered but

81
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.255
not yet processed
in the open set.

82
00:03:26.255 --> 00:03:28.550
The key difference
is that instead

83
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.500
of using a queue
for the open set,

84
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.915
we'll be using a min heap.

85
00:03:32.915 --> 00:03:35.210
A min heap is
a data structure that

86
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.220
stores keys and values,

87
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.140
and sorts the keys in terms of

88
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.665
their associated values
from smallest to largest.

89
00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:47.135
In our case, the values of
each key vertex in the graph

90
00:03:47.135 --> 00:03:49.190
will correspond to
the distance it

91
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.420
takes to reach that vertex,

92
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.520
along the shortest path to

93
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.085
that vertex we've found so far.

94
00:03:56.085 --> 00:03:59.330
In this sense, Dijkstra's
algorithm processes

95
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.025
vertices with a lower accumulated
cost before other ones.

96
00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:08.000
Thus unlike BFS, a vertex
that was added later

97
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.620
in the search can be processed

98
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.035
before when that
was added earlier,

99
00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:15.760
so long as it's accumulated
cost is lower.

100
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.470
Other than that,
Dijkstra's algorithm is

101
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.960
largely the same as BFS.

102
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.075
Progressing through the vertices,

103
00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:25.280
while adding and
popping them off of

104
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.940
the min heap until
the goal vertex is processed.

105
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.770
One interesting case however,

106
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.070
is if we find a new path
to a vertex that is

107
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.940
already in the open heap but
has not been processed yet.

108
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.510
In this case, we have to
check if the newly found path

109
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.990
to this vertex is cheaper
than the old path.

110
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.910
If it is, we need to update

111
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.420
its cost in the
min-heap otherwise,

112
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.270
no action is required.

113
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.610
Once we process the goal vertex
we must have necessarily

114
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.010
processed all
possible predecessor

115
00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.765
vertices of the goal node.

116
00:04:59.765 --> 00:05:02.449
Since a predecessor
must have accumulated

117
00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.290
distance less than or
equal to the goal vertex.

118
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.770
Since all predecessor vertices
have been processed,

119
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.115
we will have found the shortest
path to the goal vertex.

120
00:05:13.115 --> 00:05:15.364
Once the goal vertex
has been processed,

121
00:05:15.364 --> 00:05:17.665
so the algorithm can terminate.

122
00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:19.825
To solidify our understanding,

123
00:05:19.825 --> 00:05:21.770
let's step through
the application of

124
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.410
Dijkstra's algorithm to
our new weighted graph.

125
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.310
For our graph as with BFS,

126
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.170
the first vertex to process is S,

127
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.760
which then adds A,

128
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.100
B and C, to the min heap.

129
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.770
By default, the accumulated
cost of the origin S is zero.

130
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.365
So the cost to reach A, B and C,

131
00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:45.290
is five, seven and
two respectively.

132
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.480
Since we are using a min-heap

133
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.865
instead of a queue for
Dijkstra's algorithm,

134
00:05:49.865 --> 00:05:52.580
the order of
the open vertices is now

135
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.415
CAB sorted from lowest cost
to highest cost in the heap.

136
00:05:57.415 --> 00:06:01.205
We store each of these
vertices predecessors as S,

137
00:06:01.205 --> 00:06:03.905
and then add S to the closed set.

138
00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:06.740
Next, we pop C from the heap.

139
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.700
Since it is the lowest
cost vertex so far.

140
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.805
C is only connected to E,

141
00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:13.395
which has not yet
been discovered.

142
00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:15.320
So we add it to the min heap with

143
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.585
a cost of two plus eight is ten,

144
00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:20.225
along with C as its predecessor.

145
00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:22.460
Our new heap ordering is A,

146
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.540
B and E. We then add
C to the closed set.

147
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.465
The next vertex to pop
off the heap is A,

148
00:06:29.465 --> 00:06:31.700
which connects to both D and B.

149
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.500
D is not yet been explored,

150
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.820
so we add it to the heap with

151
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.235
a cost of five plus
two for seven,

152
00:06:37.235 --> 00:06:39.830
and b however has
been explored as it

153
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.935
currently has an accumulated
cost of seven.

154
00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:45.560
The edge AB has weight one,

155
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.285
so the new cost of going through

156
00:06:47.285 --> 00:06:49.805
A is five plus one for six.

157
00:06:49.805 --> 00:06:51.530
Since this is lower than

158
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.780
the current cost of
B which was seven,

159
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.585
we update the cost of
B in the heap to six,

160
00:06:56.585 --> 00:06:59.795
and change its
predecessor from S to A.

161
00:06:59.795 --> 00:07:02.570
To show that the cost
of B was updated,

162
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.675
we have marked the new edge
to be as purple.

163
00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:08.240
We then close vertex A.

164
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.315
Our vertex ordering in
the min heap is now B,

165
00:07:11.315 --> 00:07:15.920
D and E. We now pop
B off of the heap,

166
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.755
which only connects to E.

167
00:07:17.755 --> 00:07:20.770
The cost so far to
reach B is six,

168
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.150
which gives us a cost
of nine to reach

169
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.130
E. E was already

170
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.410
stored in the min heap
with a cost of ten.

171
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.560
So, we need to update
the cost of E to nine,

172
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.845
as well as change
its predecessor from C to B.

173
00:07:33.845 --> 00:07:36.350
Finally, we close vertex B.

174
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.570
Our new vertex ordering
in the min-heap is

175
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.635
D then E. Next,

176
00:07:41.635 --> 00:07:44.930
we pop D off of the heap
which connects both E and

177
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.559
T. E is already in
the heap with cost nine,

178
00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:51.770
and the new path from D
to E has a cost of 14.

179
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.900
Since this is higher
than E's current cost,

180
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.975
we can ignore this new path.

181
00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.955
To show that we've ignored it,

182
00:07:57.955 --> 00:08:01.880
we mark the new edge to E
as red instead of purple.

183
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.010
We then add T to the heap of

184
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.635
a cost of seven
plus one is eight,

185
00:08:06.635 --> 00:08:09.070
setting D as its predecessor.

186
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:13.230
Finally, we close vertex D.
Our new heap ordering is

187
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.920
T and then E. The final vertex
that we pop off is T,

188
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.535
which is our goal vertex.

189
00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:21.680
This completes
the planning process,

190
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.830
and we now have an optimal path
formed by chaining

191
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.450
together the predecessors of

192
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.715
T all the way back to the origin,

193
00:08:28.715 --> 00:08:31.165
as highlighted on
this graph here.

194
00:08:31.165 --> 00:08:33.500
Next, let's take a look at how

195
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.335
this mission planning problem
looks on a real map.

196
00:08:36.335 --> 00:08:38.980
Here we have a map of
Berkeley, California.

197
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.210
Where the vertices of
the graph correspond

198
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.790
to intersections, and
the edges correspond to

199
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.235
road segments as we
discussed earlier.

200
00:08:46.235 --> 00:08:47.930
The two red dots,

201
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.465
correspond to the start and end

202
00:08:49.465 --> 00:08:51.560
points of our required plan.

203
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.160
We have to remember that
certain roads are one-way roads.

204
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.935
As such, the graph is directed.

205
00:08:57.935 --> 00:08:59.989
After running
Dijkstra's algorithm,

206
00:08:59.989 --> 00:09:01.460
the shortest path between

207
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.005
the two nodes is given
by the red path.

208
00:09:05.005 --> 00:09:07.975
Dijkstra's algorithm
is quite efficient,

209
00:09:07.975 --> 00:09:10.250
which allows it to
scale really well to

210
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.325
real-world problems such
as the ones shown here.

211
00:09:13.325 --> 00:09:15.140
In fact, it even works with

212
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.880
a much larger scale problems such

213
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.220
as navigating over New York City.

214
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.055
Whose road network graph
is shown below.

215
00:09:22.055 --> 00:09:24.515
While Dijkstra's is
an efficient algorithm,

216
00:09:24.515 --> 00:09:26.390
we can leverage
certain heuristics to

217
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.590
make it even faster in practice,

218
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.550
which we'll discuss
in our next lesson.

219
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.549
Now that we've worked
through a full example,

220
00:09:34.549 --> 00:09:37.430
let's review what we
discussed in this video.

221
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.060
We first introduced the concept
of a weighted graph,

222
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.640
and discussed that having
the ability to make

223
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.940
certain edges have
higher weights than others,

224
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.520
better reflects the
autonomous driving mission.

225
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.685
As different roads are
longer than others.

226
00:09:52.685 --> 00:09:54.785
As a consequence of this,

227
00:09:54.785 --> 00:09:57.890
our breadth-first search
algorithm no longer works.

228
00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.930
So we introduced
Dijkstra's algorithm,

229
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.345
to handle this added complexity.

230
00:10:02.345 --> 00:10:03.800
In our next lesson,

231
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.080
we'll be discussing how
to solve these problems

232
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.085
more efficiently using
search heuristics.

233
00:10:09.085 --> 00:10:12.160
We'll introduce
the A-star algorithm.
