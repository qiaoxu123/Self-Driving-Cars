00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.245
Welcome to the sixth module

2
00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:24.105
of our Motion Planning course.

3
00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.340
In this module, we'll
introduce you to

4
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.320
some of the concepts
required for you

5
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.585
to take a kinematic bicycle model

6
00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:33.560
and build a reactive
motion planner from it.

7
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.840
A reactive motion
planner is one that

8
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.760
takes in local information from

9
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.530
the robot's surroundings in order

10
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.420
to generate a trajectory that

11
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.010
is collision-free and makes

12
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.470
progress towards
some goal location.

13
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.600
We'll stick to static
environments in

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.460
this module as a first step

15
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.230
on our way to planning behaviors

16
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.575
and paths for self-driving cars.

17
00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:55.790
We'll also introduce
the concepts of

18
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.345
path prediction and collision
checking as we go along.

19
00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:01.670
In this video,
we'll be discussing

20
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.440
how to generate trajectories in

21
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.660
a discrete setting for a sequence

22
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.345
of control inputs
to our robot model.

23
00:01:08.345 --> 00:01:10.190
By the end of this video,

24
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.634
you should understand
the difference between

25
00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:15.890
a kinematic and dynamic motion
model and you should have

26
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.030
a firm grasp of

27
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.940
the bicycle model that we
introduced in course one.

28
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.740
In addition, you should be able

29
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.390
to generate trajectories from

30
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.845
control inputs for our bicycle
model. Let's get started.

31
00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:29.660
First, we want to do

32
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.420
a brief review of what
a kinematic model is.

33
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.540
A kinematic model gives the
equations of motion for

34
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.339
our robot while disregarding

35
00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:40.520
the impacts of mass and
inertia on its motion.

36
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.440
We can contrast this with

37
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.510
a dynamic model
which instead takes

38
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.680
mass and inertia into

39
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.320
consideration at the cost
of being more complex.

40
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.070
Kinematic models focus on linear

41
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.409
and angular velocities
and occasionally,

42
00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.435
their derivatives as inputs,

43
00:01:56.435 --> 00:01:58.310
whereas dynamic models focus on

44
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.650
forces and torques as inputs.

45
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.740
To illustrate this, we have
a kinematic particle model

46
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.020
contrasted with
the dynamic particle model

47
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.850
with friction shown here.

48
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.030
For path planning and
trajectory optimization,

49
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.430
we often focus on
kinematic models to

50
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.100
make the motion planning problem
more computationally

51
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.830
tractable and leave
the issues raised

52
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.310
by the simplification of
the dynamics to the controller.

53
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.470
To give a concrete example,

54
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.560
here we have the equations of
motion for a bicycle model

55
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.565
of our robot which you should
recall from course one.

56
00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:34.150
What do these equations mean?

57
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.640
Essentially, we define
the base link of the robot as

58
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.405
being in the position xy in
a fixed coordinate frame.

59
00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:44.090
We also take the heading
of the robot

60
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.700
to be Theta relative
to the x-axis.

61
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.150
Taking these together, the
xy position along with

62
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.500
the heading Theta gives us

63
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.125
the state of the robot
at any point.

64
00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:55.760
For the bicycle model,

65
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.740
the inputs given at each point in

66
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.740
time are the velocity
and the steering angle.

67
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.275
These inputs along
with the current state

68
00:03:03.275 --> 00:03:05.270
are what allow us
to calculate how

69
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.475
a trajectory will
evolve with time

70
00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:11.520
according to the bicycle model
kinematic equations.

71
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.710
One thing to take away
from this is that we often

72
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.680
do not have direct access
to the state of the robot.

73
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.380
We cannot tell the robot
directly to go

74
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.185
to a specific position
in x and y.

75
00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:28.190
We can however, devise
a sequence of control inputs,

76
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.340
u sub n that will
allow us to reach said

77
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.895
xy position according to
the kinematic equations.

78
00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:37.370
The sequence of
control inputs will

79
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.255
correspond to a trajectory
that the robot will follow.

80
00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:43.250
Now that we've seen an example of

81
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.320
some kinematic equations,
you might be asking,

82
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.880
"How do we actually calculate

83
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.825
a trajectory for
a given sequence of inputs?"

84
00:03:49.825 --> 00:03:51.800
The kinematic
equations we've given

85
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.480
you essentially amount to

86
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.425
a system of continuous time
differential equations.

87
00:03:57.425 --> 00:04:00.139
For trajectory
generation purposes,

88
00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.630
we'll be focusing on
the discrete analog of

89
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.700
these equations as
discussed in course one.

90
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.710
By focusing on
the discrete model,

91
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.490
it allows us to easily
and efficiently propagate

92
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.865
trajectories for a given
sequence of control inputs.

93
00:04:13.865 --> 00:04:16.130
Many methods exist
for discretizing

94
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.220
continuous time differential
equations and we use

95
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.715
a simple zero-order hold
here and have provided you

96
00:04:22.715 --> 00:04:24.080
with additional resources in

97
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.420
the supplemental materials
if you'd like to see more.

98
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.680
A consequence of
the discretization

99
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.465
of these equations is that we can

100
00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:34.280
implement the sum over all of

101
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.235
the updates in
the sequence recursively,

102
00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.840
which allows us to build up

103
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.640
the full trajectory iteratively

104
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.845
for a given sequence of inputs.

105
00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:45.260
This saves in
computational effort

106
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.075
because rather than recomputing

107
00:04:47.075 --> 00:04:49.340
a sum over all previous updates

108
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.395
for each point in the trajectory,

109
00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:54.110
we can incrementally
compute the next point of

110
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.920
the trajectory using only the
previously computed point.

111
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.740
This is shown as
the final right-hand side

112
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.275
for each of the state
variable equations.

113
00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:05.780
We will be using
this recursive solution

114
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.565
throughout this module.

115
00:05:07.565 --> 00:05:10.490
If we now apply
this discretization and

116
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.670
step through an entire
control input sequence,

117
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.755
we will get an
accurate approximation

118
00:05:15.755 --> 00:05:18.230
of the trajectory that
the robot will follow.

119
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.750
While this is useful for
trajectory planning,

120
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.360
it is also useful for
motion prediction,

121
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.070
where we know
a kinematic model of

122
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.080
a different agent in
the driving scenario

123
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.195
and we have an educated guess

124
00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:31.325
on the control inputs
they will take.

125
00:05:31.325 --> 00:05:33.320
From this, we can estimate

126
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.690
their future trajectory
which can help us

127
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.990
plan our motion to
avoid collisions.

128
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.690
As an example, suppose we take

129
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.820
a constant velocity
input as well as

130
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.825
a constant steering angle
to our bicycle model.

131
00:05:46.825 --> 00:05:49.480
As shown here in the animation,

132
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.490
this results in the robot
traversing the arc with

133
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.590
constant speed while it's heading

134
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.440
slowly changes with
each time step.

135
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.485
If we instead vary
the steering angle

136
00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.530
along the path according
to some steering function,

137
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.914
we can perform
more complex maneuvers,

138
00:06:05.914 --> 00:06:10.025
which are critical for such
tasks as obstacle avoidance.

139
00:06:10.025 --> 00:06:12.020
This is essentially the crux

140
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.535
of the local planning problem,

141
00:06:13.535 --> 00:06:16.340
calculating the
required control inputs

142
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.715
to safely navigate to
a given goal point.

143
00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:22.640
In the animation, we can
see that driving with

144
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.470
a constant steering
angle as we did

145
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.975
before would result
in a collision.

146
00:06:26.975 --> 00:06:30.500
To remedy this, we have given
the robot a sequence of

147
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.300
different steering angle inputs

148
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.460
in order to avoid the obstacle.

149
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.740
We're now ready to
start planning paths

150
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.580
through environments
with obstacles.

151
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.310
In this video, we reviewed
the difference between

152
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.770
kinematic and dynamic models as

153
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.060
well as the bicycle model

154
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.120
that we introduced in course one.

155
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.470
From there, we discussed how to

156
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.870
compute trajectories
for a given model

157
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.105
and set of control inputs using

158
00:06:56.105 --> 00:06:58.775
our trajectory
propagation algorithm.

159
00:06:58.775 --> 00:07:01.490
This algorithm will come
in handy when we develop

160
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.405
the rest of our motion planner
in this module.

161
00:07:04.405 --> 00:07:06.380
Hopefully, this video
has given you

162
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.015
some insight on how to take

163
00:07:08.015 --> 00:07:10.520
a robot's kinematic
model and generate

164
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.130
a trajectory for it
given arbitrary inputs.

165
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.210
In our next video,

166
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.580
we will discuss some
efficient collision checking

167
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.230
methods that we can use

168
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.585
when evaluating
different plan paths

169
00:07:20.585 --> 00:07:23.430
for safety. See you there.
