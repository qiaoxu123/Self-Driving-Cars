00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.980
Hello everyone, and welcome to

2
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.395
our final lesson in module six.

3
00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:21.705
In this video, we'll
discuss how to

4
00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:23.940
augment the trajectory
rollout algorithm we

5
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.785
developed in the previous lesson

6
00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:28.950
with a technique known
as dynamic windowing.

7
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.370
Dynamic windowing will allow
us to place linear and

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.620
angular acceleration constraints

9
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.054
on the vehicle's trajectory,

10
00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:37.940
in order to promote comfort as

11
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.820
the vehicle progresses
between planning cycles.

12
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.580
Specifically, by
the end of this video,

13
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.620
you should be able to add

14
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.050
acceleration constraints
to the bicycle model

15
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.735
derived in course one,

16
00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:52.010
and you should be able to modify

17
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.110
the trajectory
rollout algorithm to

18
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.730
accommodate these new constraints

19
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.485
using dynamic windowing.

20
00:00:57.485 --> 00:01:01.670
Let's get started.
First, let's revisit

21
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.380
lesson one where we discussed

22
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.155
the kinematic equations
for a bicycle model.

23
00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:08.480
Essentially, the two inputs to

24
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.880
the bicycle model are the linear

25
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.665
velocity in the steering angle,

26
00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:13.640
which change the position and

27
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.545
heading of the robot over time.

28
00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:19.640
One thing to notice
with this entire set of

29
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.440
kinematic equations
is that there is

30
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.660
no consideration of
higher-order terms,

31
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.075
such as acceleration or jerk.

32
00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:28.040
These higher-order terms are what

33
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.455
cause discomfort for
passengers in the car,

34
00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:34.310
so we should try to address
this in our kinematic model.

35
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.760
Even without incorporating
the full dynamic models

36
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.035
discussed in course one

37
00:01:39.035 --> 00:01:41.154
into the trajectory
planning process,

38
00:01:41.154 --> 00:01:43.730
we can restrict
the selected inputs to

39
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.705
consider the effects of
rapid changes on ride comfort.

40
00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:51.530
We can do this by adding
a constraint for the range of

41
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.630
linear and angular accelerations

42
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.795
permitted for our bicycle model.

43
00:01:55.795 --> 00:01:57.890
This will limit
the extent to which

44
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.990
passengers in our vehicle
will experience

45
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.880
forces and torques while

46
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.700
our vehicle traverses
its planned trajectory.

47
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.195
However, this comes
with a trade-off.

48
00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:08.840
Our motion planner will lose

49
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.860
some maneuverability at
each planning iteration.

50
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.180
Specifically, after adding

51
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.190
this angular
acceleration constraint,

52
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.200
we may not be able to move to

53
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.620
every possible steering angle
in our steering angle set,

54
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.060
because they may induce too

55
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.220
high of an angular acceleration.

56
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.785
In addition, we may
not be able to ramp

57
00:02:27.785 --> 00:02:29.540
our velocity up or down as

58
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.045
quickly between
planning iterations.

59
00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:35.060
Let's focus on the angular
acceleration constraint

60
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.265
and derive the resulting
steering angle restriction.

61
00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:40.850
Recall that the
angular velocity for

62
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.900
the bicycle model is given
by vtandelta over L.

63
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.570
The magnitude of
the angular acceleration

64
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.640
is therefore
approximately given by

65
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.240
the absolute difference between
the angular velocities of

66
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.560
our start and ending

67
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.210
steering angles divided by
the time step we're using.

68
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.140
Rearranging the terms
using the fact that

69
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.330
v and L are always
positive for our planner,

70
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.780
we have the requirement that

71
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.560
the absolute value of the tan
of delta at time two minus

72
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.820
the tan of delta at time

73
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.340
one must be less than
or equal to theta

74
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.350
double-dot max times L over

75
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.880
v. To help solidify how
this impacts our planner,

76
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.550
let's analyze a concrete example.

77
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.400
Suppose our bicycle
model is moving at

78
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.830
a constant linear
velocity of one meter

79
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.714
per second across
all candidate trajectories,

80
00:03:30.714 --> 00:03:33.950
and has a current steering angle
of pi over eight.

81
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.010
Suppose the maximum and
minimum steering angle for

82
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.390
this robot or pi over

83
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.119
four and minus pi over
four respectively,

84
00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.765
and that our steering angle
step size is pi over eight.

85
00:03:44.765 --> 00:03:47.794
In addition, suppose our
trajectories are sampled

86
00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:50.809
at a time resolution
of 0.1 seconds,

87
00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:52.700
and that our bicycle model robot

88
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.955
has a length of one meter.

89
00:03:54.955 --> 00:03:58.550
Finally, let's constrain
our angular acceleration

90
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.220
to 0.6 radians per
second squared.

91
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.020
Let's apply our derived
steering angle constraints

92
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.775
to this example problem.

93
00:04:07.775 --> 00:04:10.700
We have that our current
steering angle delta

94
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.440
one is pi over eight.

95
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.245
By substituting
each potential steering angle

96
00:04:15.245 --> 00:04:17.240
into our steering angle set,

97
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.580
we see that the angular
acceleration constraint

98
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.050
is violated if we

99
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.730
were to change
our steering angle to

100
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.445
minus pi over eight or
minus pi over four.

101
00:04:25.445 --> 00:04:28.505
However, changing
it to pi over four

102
00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:31.460
zero or keeping it the
same at pi over eight,

103
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.945
are all valid selections

104
00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:35.225
according to our new constraints.

105
00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:37.370
To illustrate this,
we have colored

106
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.530
the disallowed trajectories red.

107
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.090
The remaining
trajectories colored in

108
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.920
green are still available to

109
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.970
the subsequent step of

110
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.260
the reactive planner that we

111
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.500
developed in the previous lesson.

112
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.000
This illustrates that in general,

113
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.830
the added constraints will reduce

114
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.815
the maneuverability of
the robot to a certain extent,

115
00:04:54.815 --> 00:04:57.650
while promoting
more comfortable trajectories.

116
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.380
The more restrictive
the set of constraints,

117
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.335
the less maneuverable
the robot will be.

118
00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:06.470
We can also apply
similar logic to the case of

119
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.810
a linear acceleration
constraint and

120
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.035
a range of linear velocity
inputs available to us,

121
00:05:12.035 --> 00:05:13.910
or even have both constraints

122
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.525
applied to the robot
at the same time.

123
00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:19.235
In general, the dynamic
window approach

124
00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:20.480
allows us to incorporate

125
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.400
more restrictions on how

126
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.695
the trajectory evolves
during planning,

127
00:05:24.695 --> 00:05:27.320
resulting in motion
that better satisfies

128
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.145
a broad set of objectives
simultaneously.

129
00:05:30.145 --> 00:05:32.245
To summarize this lesson,

130
00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:35.390
we first introduced additional
acceleration constraints

131
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.890
to our bicycle model.

132
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.020
We then derive the process of

133
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.305
dynamic windowing to restrict
our trajectory set at

134
00:05:42.305 --> 00:05:44.600
each time step in
order to satisfy

135
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.890
these new constraints for

136
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.885
our trajectory rollout algorithm.

137
00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:49.610
Congratulations,

138
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.695
you've now reached
the end of this module.

139
00:05:51.695 --> 00:05:53.780
Let's review what we've covered.

140
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.030
We first developed the concept of

141
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.130
trajectory propagation
in order to

142
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.085
generate trajectories for
a given motion model.

143
00:06:01.085 --> 00:06:03.800
We then moved on to
collision checking,

144
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.600
which is necessary for developing

145
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.355
collision-free motion plans
for our autonomous vehicle.

146
00:06:09.355 --> 00:06:12.410
Then, we combined
these two concepts into

147
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.440
the trajectory rollout planner
and augmented it

148
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.940
using dynamic windowing to

149
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.375
handle acceleration constraints.

150
00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:22.430
By now, you should have
a strong foundation in

151
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.140
reactive planning centered on

152
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.880
the trajectory rollout algorithm.

153
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.830
This is a compact and effective

154
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.690
general motion planning strategy

155
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.630
suitable for a wide range
of planning tasks,

156
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.885
with a wide variety of
objectives and constraints.

157
00:06:35.885 --> 00:06:37.430
In the next module,

158
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.110
we will start our discussion of

159
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.680
dynamic environments and use
trajectory propagation and

160
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.230
collision detection to
predict the motion of

161
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.240
other objects and determine

162
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.800
whether a collision might occur.

163
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.820
See you there.
