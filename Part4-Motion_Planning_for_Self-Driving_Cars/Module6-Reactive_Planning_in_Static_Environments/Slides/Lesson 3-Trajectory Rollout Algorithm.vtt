00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.710
Hi everyone, and welcome to

2
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.945
this lesson on reactive planning.

3
00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:21.510
In this video, we'll combine
some of the knowledge we

4
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.850
acquired from
the two previous lessons,

5
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.310
to develop a reactive motion
planning algorithm

6
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.190
known as the trajectory
roll-out planner.

7
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.980
This will introduce us to

8
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.930
the task of trajectory planning,

9
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.420
which will lay the groundwork
for us to progress to

10
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.890
more advanced planning methods

11
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.245
presented later in module seven.

12
00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:41.120
By the end of this video,

13
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.650
you should be able to implement

14
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.615
the trajectory
roll-out algorithm.

15
00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:47.805
This includes the trajectory
propagation step,

16
00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:49.615
the collision checking step,

17
00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:51.830
and the path selection step in

18
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.455
order to achieve
the desired goal state.

19
00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:56.690
You should also understand how to

20
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.045
apply the receding
horizon concept

21
00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:01.520
to planning and
the main drawbacks

22
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.875
associated with
this type of planner.

23
00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:05.495
At a high level,

24
00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:07.490
the trajectory
roll-out planner uses

25
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.640
the method of trajectory
propagation discussed in lesson

26
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.070
one to generate a set of

27
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.200
candidate trajectories
that the robot can

28
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.605
follow from its current
point in the workspace.

29
00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:21.890
We then take the obstacle
information local to

30
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.360
the robot and determine

31
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.405
which paths are collision-free
and which aren't.

32
00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:28.744
Of these collision-free paths,

33
00:01:28.744 --> 00:01:30.290
we then select the one that

34
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.810
maximizes an objective function,

35
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.310
which will include a term that

36
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.070
rewards progress
towards the goal.

37
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.365
By performing this repeatedly,

38
00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:42.650
we end up with a receding
horizon planner that reacts

39
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.970
to the environment while making

40
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.460
steady progress towards the goal.

41
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.590
Let's go over each
of these steps in

42
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.290
more detail so you can
implement this yourself.

43
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.370
The first step of
the algorithm is to

44
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.670
generate the set of
trajectories at each time step.

45
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.090
How do we do this?

46
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.825
For trajectory roll-out,

47
00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:04.685
each trajectory will
correspond to applying

48
00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:07.130
a fixed input to the robot for

49
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.070
multiple steps over
a constant time horizon.

50
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.145
We uniformly sample
these fixed inputs

51
00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:14.450
across the range of

52
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.820
available input values
in order to

53
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.570
generate a variety of potential
candidate trajectories.

54
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.520
By reaching a wide variety of

55
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.025
trajectories across
the input spectrum,

56
00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:28.355
we improve the quality of
our trajectory search and

57
00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:30.755
our maneuverability
as we are exploring

58
00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:34.240
a broader set of candidate
paths for the robot to take.

59
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.160
If we only use
a small range of inputs,

60
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.140
then our computation
time improves.

61
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.780
But there may be
potential trajectory candidates

62
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.955
that we miss out on
in our computation,

63
00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.950
which could reduce the quality of

64
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.640
the trajectory generated
by our planner.

65
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.603
However, sampling

66
00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:52.790
too many candidate trajectories
means that we have

67
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.500
additional computational
overhead at

68
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.140
each step as each
additional trajectory

69
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.370
will need to be generated,

70
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.200
checked for collisions,
and scored.

71
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.970
Once we've chosen
our set of inputs,

72
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.350
we then need to generate

73
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.500
the future states along
the trajectory by propagating

74
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.960
the state forward using
the kinematic model

75
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.235
of the vehicle as we
discussed in lesson one.

76
00:03:15.235 --> 00:03:17.700
Recall that for
the bicycle model,

77
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.335
the two inputs are the velocity
in the steering angle.

78
00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:23.750
If we hold the velocity constant,

79
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.700
but vary the steering
angle across

80
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.570
the range minus pie over
four to pie over four,

81
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.390
we now have a set of arcs as
our candidate trajectories.

82
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.820
These arcs are
generated by evaluating

83
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.905
the kinematic
equations recursively

84
00:03:36.905 --> 00:03:39.095
as we discussed in lesson one.

85
00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:40.880
Now that we have the set of arcs,

86
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.125
we can check to see which ones
are collision-free.

87
00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:46.525
For a collision
checking algorithm,

88
00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:49.790
we're going to assume that we
are given an occupancy grid

89
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.650
that represents a discretization

90
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.255
of the vehicles workspace.

91
00:03:53.255 --> 00:03:55.580
This discretization
will be stored in

92
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.010
the form of a matrix
where each value of

93
00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.360
the matrix will denote if

94
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.800
the corresponding position in

95
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.320
the workspace is occupied or not.

96
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.350
We can then perform
collision checking using

97
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.760
the swath-based method we

98
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.770
discussed in the previous video.

99
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.530
Recall that we
generate the swath by

100
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.500
sweeping the body of
the robot along the path,

101
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.985
and taking the union of

102
00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:18.200
all the footprints at

103
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.720
each time step of
a given trajectory.

104
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.780
The footprint of the car
will correspond to

105
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.330
a set of indices in
the occupancy grid.

106
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.525
So each rotated and translated
point along the path

107
00:04:29.525 --> 00:04:31.010
will also correspond to

108
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.710
different indices in
the occupancy grid.

109
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.720
These indices will be stored in

110
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.945
a set data structure to
eliminate duplicates.

111
00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.940
We can then check each point of

112
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.630
the swath to see which points of

113
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.090
the swath overlap with

114
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.490
occupied elements of
the occupancy grid.

115
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.470
We do this by iterating through

116
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.360
each point in the swath set

117
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.370
and checking the associated index

118
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.770
in the occupancy grid
for an obstacle.

119
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.785
If any point in
the swath is occupied,

120
00:04:57.785 --> 00:05:00.500
then that trajectory
contains a collision.

121
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.150
Once we've iterated through

122
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.840
every trajectory generated
in the previous step,

123
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.640
we will be left with a set of

124
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.040
collision-free kinematically
feasible trajectories

125
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.670
that we can then score using
our objective function.

126
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.620
The primary element that

127
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.200
every objective function
needs is some way

128
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.280
of rewarding progress towards
some goal point or region,

129
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.360
which is the ultimate goal

130
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.950
of our motion planning problem.

131
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.560
A simple and effective way
to do this is to

132
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.810
have a term in the objective
function that is

133
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.270
proportional to
the distance from the end

134
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.025
of the candidate trajectory
to the goal node.

135
00:05:36.025 --> 00:05:39.170
However, sometimes
we will also want to

136
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.215
encourage other behavior
in our reactive planner.

137
00:05:42.215 --> 00:05:44.395
As we saw in module one,

138
00:05:44.395 --> 00:05:47.120
some examples of
objective functions include

139
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.120
minimizing the distance from
the center line of a lane,

140
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.135
we're penalizing
the curvature of a path.

141
00:05:53.135 --> 00:05:56.260
Sometimes, we also
want to reward paths

142
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.365
that maximize the distance
to the nearest obstacle,

143
00:05:59.365 --> 00:06:01.660
to maximize the flexibility of

144
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.310
feasible paths available to

145
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.485
future time steps in the planner.

146
00:06:05.485 --> 00:06:07.570
As we discussed in module one,

147
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.000
there is no perfect
objective function,

148
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.170
and you will need to craft

149
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.555
your own objective functions
to fit your application.

150
00:06:14.555 --> 00:06:16.895
For our reactive planner,

151
00:06:16.895 --> 00:06:18.460
we will use the distance to

152
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.054
the goal as our objective
function to minimize,

153
00:06:21.054 --> 00:06:23.740
which is the first
equation shown here.

154
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.620
Once we have
the objective function,

155
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.500
we can iterate over
the collision-free trajectories,

156
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.720
and pick the path that maximizes
the objective function,

157
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.160
or minimizes the penalty

158
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.170
depending on how you
formulate the objective.

159
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.430
Let's go over a concrete example

160
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.515
to bring the whole
algorithm together.

161
00:06:42.515 --> 00:06:44.884
Pictured here, we
have the obstacles

162
00:06:44.884 --> 00:06:47.120
in the occupancy grid
given in red,

163
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.400
the goal region in yellow,

164
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.075
and the initial point to
the car at zero, zero, zero.

165
00:06:53.075 --> 00:06:56.990
Suppose our range of steering
angles is between minus pie

166
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.685
over four and pie over four

167
00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:00.935
with a pie over eight step size,

168
00:07:00.935 --> 00:07:02.270
and suppose we are using

169
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.690
a constant velocity of
0.5 meters per second.

170
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.430
In addition, let's assume

171
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.070
our planner is using
a time step of 0.1

172
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.560
seconds and each plan trajectory

173
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.755
lasts for two seconds in total.

174
00:07:14.755 --> 00:07:17.915
If we apply our trajectory
propagation algorithm

175
00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:19.340
that we outlined in lesson one

176
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.545
using our bicycle
kinematics model,

177
00:07:21.545 --> 00:07:24.410
we can then generate
a set of paths for

178
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.530
each selected steering angle
in our steering range.

179
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.020
The first trajectory
has a steering angle of

180
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.525
minus pie over
four and as a result,

181
00:07:32.525 --> 00:07:35.450
we can see that the trajectory
curves to the right.

182
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.850
Our next trajectory has
a steering angle of

183
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.310
minus pie over eight
and as you can see,

184
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.840
the trajectory generated has

185
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.195
a smaller curvature
than the first one.

186
00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:47.480
Next, we have the zero
steering angle trajectory

187
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.710
which results in the car

188
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.085
driving forward in
a straight line.

189
00:07:51.085 --> 00:07:53.315
The positive steering
angle trajectories

190
00:07:53.315 --> 00:07:54.350
are symmetrical to

191
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.440
the negative steering angle
trajectories and as expected,

192
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.840
turn the car to the left.

193
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.080
Now that we have a candidate set
of trajectories,

194
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.430
we need to check each

195
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.395
one to see if they
are collision-free

196
00:08:06.395 --> 00:08:08.525
using the collision
checking algorithm

197
00:08:08.525 --> 00:08:10.445
we outlined in the last video,

198
00:08:10.445 --> 00:08:12.725
and reviewed earlier in this one.

199
00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:15.110
After translating and rotating

200
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.495
the footprints along
each trajectory,

201
00:08:17.495 --> 00:08:19.940
we check each occupancy
grid index in

202
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.300
the resulting swath to see
if an obstacle is present.

203
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.570
If any of the indices
contain an obstacle,

204
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.585
then that path is marked
as having a collision,

205
00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:32.405
which we've denoted
by the color red.

206
00:08:32.405 --> 00:08:35.570
All collision-free paths
are colored green,

207
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.595
which we can then evaluate using

208
00:08:37.595 --> 00:08:40.610
our objective function
to find the best one.

209
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.725
Recall that
our objective function

210
00:08:42.725 --> 00:08:44.585
is the distance to the goal.

211
00:08:44.585 --> 00:08:46.880
The path that minimizes
this distance

212
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.265
to the goal is now
colored in black.

213
00:08:49.265 --> 00:08:52.700
This completes our first
planning iteration.

214
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.680
At this point, we now have

215
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.780
a trajectory for
the vehicle to execute.

216
00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.030
However, we will
not fully execute

217
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.660
this trajectory before
the next planning cycle.

218
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.725
Instead, the vehicle will execute

219
00:09:03.725 --> 00:09:05.810
only the first few points
of the cycle.

220
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.200
The exact number depends on
the planning frequency and

221
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.880
our planning horizon
will be shifted

222
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.240
forward depending
on our progress.

223
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.950
This is exactly the receding

224
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.750
horizon approach you applied to

225
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.070
vehicle control in

226
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.425
the first course in
this specialization.

227
00:09:20.425 --> 00:09:22.075
Bringing this all together,

228
00:09:22.075 --> 00:09:23.245
at each time step,

229
00:09:23.245 --> 00:09:25.165
we plan a two-second trajectory,

230
00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:28.435
but only execute one second
of it at a time.

231
00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:30.730
By doing this, the end time of

232
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.530
our planning horizon
shifts forward by

233
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.005
one second for
each planning cycle.

234
00:09:35.005 --> 00:09:37.930
This is known as
a receding horizon planner

235
00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.640
because at each
planning cycle we have

236
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.750
a fixed planning time
horizon whose n times

237
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.100
slowly recedes towards
the time point

238
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.750
at which we reach the goal.

239
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.490
This is illustrated
here where the

240
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.620
black is the portion of
the trajectory that will

241
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.600
be executed on the current cycle

242
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.675
and the orange part is
the leftover portion.

243
00:09:55.675 --> 00:09:58.405
Once the next planning
cycle begins,

244
00:09:58.405 --> 00:10:00.585
we repeat the whole
process again.

245
00:10:00.585 --> 00:10:03.110
We continue this process
until we compute

246
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.690
a trajectory that
reaches the goal region,

247
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.210
which we check at the end
of each iteration.

248
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.150
You can now see the rest of
the steps that the planner

249
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.970
took to the goal region
in our example problem.

250
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.630
One caveat to notice about

251
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.820
this planner is
that it is myopic.

252
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.165
That is, it doesn't plan
a path directly to the goal.

253
00:10:23.165 --> 00:10:25.910
It instead greedily
sample sub-paths

254
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.195
according to how close they
get the robot to the goal.

255
00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:32.165
This can cause the planner
to be shortsighted,

256
00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:34.025
to get stuck in dead ends,

257
00:10:34.025 --> 00:10:35.720
and in general, will
cause the planner

258
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.155
to find sub-optimal paths.

259
00:10:38.155 --> 00:10:40.240
However, this planner greatly

260
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.520
reduces the complexity of
the planning problem to

261
00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.500
the goal region and is fast

262
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.290
enough that it can be used
as an online planner.

263
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.555
To summarize this video,

264
00:10:49.555 --> 00:10:51.280
we introduce the steps of

265
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.025
the trajectory roll-out
motion planning algorithm.

266
00:10:54.025 --> 00:10:55.990
Combining the concepts
introduced in

267
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.205
the first two lessons regarding
trajectory propagation,

268
00:10:59.205 --> 00:11:01.095
as well as, collision checking.

269
00:11:01.095 --> 00:11:02.860
To cement this concept,

270
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.950
we went over an example from
this algorithm in action.

271
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:09.070
Finally, we introduced
the concept of receding

272
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.740
horizon planners and
discussed how they can be

273
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.890
shortsighted when planning
to the goal region.

274
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.350
By now, you should
have a good idea of

275
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.165
how the trajectory
roll-out algorithm works.

276
00:11:20.165 --> 00:11:21.560
In our next lesson, we'll

277
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.720
be discussing dynamic windowing,

278
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.285
and how it can help our
trajectory roll-out algorithm

279
00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:30.210
generate more comfortable
trajectories. Until then.
