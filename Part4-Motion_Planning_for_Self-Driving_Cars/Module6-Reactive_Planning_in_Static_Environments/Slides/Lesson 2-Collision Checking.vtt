00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.770
Hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.060
our second lesson in

3
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.505
our module on reactive
motion planning.

4
00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:23.000
In this video, we'll
discuss the methods that

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.340
we can use to ensure
our motion plans

6
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.960
don't collide with obstacles in

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.250
the environment while we're

8
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.305
making progress towards our goal.

9
00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:32.510
This step is clearly crucial in

10
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.680
maintaining the safety of

11
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.975
our autonomous car
while it's driving.

12
00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:39.050
Specifically by
the end of this video,

13
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.370
you should understand some of

14
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.235
the challenges of online
collision checking.

15
00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:46.295
You should also understand
to collision checking methods,

16
00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:48.035
swath-based collision checking,

17
00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:50.110
and circle-based
collision checking.

18
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.570
Finally, you should understand
some of the hazards posed

19
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.020
by imperfect information
and discretization errors,

20
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.610
and understand how
we can mitigate

21
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.310
these issues with
conservative approximations.

22
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.685
So let's get started.
At its core,

23
00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:06.550
collision checking
in the context of

24
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.470
motion planning is the process

25
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.509
of ensuring a given trajectory

26
00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.820
or planned path when traversed by

27
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.350
an object does not

28
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.020
collide with any obstacles
along the way.

29
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.270
An important aspect to note about

30
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.639
collision checking is
that it is a challenging,

31
00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:23.200
computationally intensive

32
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.405
problem present in many domains,

33
00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:26.980
including autonomous driving and

34
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.735
other robotic applications,

35
00:01:28.735 --> 00:01:32.745
gaming, 3D animation,
and engineering design.

36
00:01:32.745 --> 00:01:36.565
Guaranteeing a safe
collision-free optimal path

37
00:01:36.565 --> 00:01:37.750
not only requires

38
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.130
perfect information
about the environment,

39
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.610
it also requires
a prohibitive amount

40
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.010
of computation power
to compute in

41
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.240
exact form especially for

42
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.195
complex shapes and
detailed environments.

43
00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:53.815
For autonomous driving which
requires real-time planning,

44
00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:56.285
we have neither of
these available to us.

45
00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:58.520
As you can recall
from module two,

46
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.110
the information given to us by

47
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.190
the occupancy grid is
an imperfect estimate,

48
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.600
which means that we
need to add buffers to

49
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.250
our collision checking algorithms

50
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.575
to make them more error tolerant.

51
00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:13.550
In exact form, collision
checking amounts to rotating and

52
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.350
translating the footprint of

53
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.620
a vehicle along every point
of a given path.

54
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.175
Each point in the footprint
is rotated by the heading at

55
00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:24.290
each path point and translated

56
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.795
by the position of
that same path point.

57
00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:29.960
This approach is
summarized by the set S,

58
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.090
where p is a path composed of

59
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.910
a set of points p and F denotes

60
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.100
a function that
returns the set points

61
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.475
contained in a footprint
rotated by theta,

62
00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:42.700
and translated by x and y.

63
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.560
For example, suppose I
have a path point at

64
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.500
one minus one and
minus pi over two.

65
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.620
To get the footprint
at this point,

66
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.340
I have to rotate the footprint

67
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.050
by minus pi over two and then

68
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.580
translate the base link of

69
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.655
our car footprint by
one and minus one.

70
00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:02.530
After performing this for
every point along the path,

71
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.990
the resulting swath of the car
along the path is given

72
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.725
by the union of each rotated
and translated footprint.

73
00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:12.215
We then check this entire set

74
00:03:12.215 --> 00:03:14.630
to see if there are
any obstacles inside it.

75
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.640
If there are, the path contains

76
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.865
a collision and otherwise
it's collision-free.

77
00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:21.740
We now need to take

78
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.510
the swath computation
in its abstract form,

79
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.910
and convert it to

80
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.320
a discrete formulation that can

81
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.255
be calculated by a computer.

82
00:03:29.255 --> 00:03:31.940
Suppose we have
a discrete representation of

83
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.350
the cars footprint and

84
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.870
the path in terms of
the occupancy grid,

85
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.765
which was discussed
in module two.

86
00:03:38.765 --> 00:03:41.210
The cars footprint contains

87
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.545
K points and the path
is endpoints long.

88
00:03:44.545 --> 00:03:47.870
Algorithmically, computing
the swath requires us to

89
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.635
rotate and translate all K
points in the cars footprint,

90
00:03:51.635 --> 00:03:55.670
and times one for
each point in the path.

91
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.370
Let's look at
a concrete example of

92
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.850
a rotation and translation
using our occupancy grid.

93
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.730
Suppose our occupancy grid
has a resolution of

94
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.530
one meter and our footprint

95
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.040
occupies the following
three grid points;

96
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.785
zero, zero, one,
zero, and two, zero.

97
00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:14.480
Suppose we have a path point
that we would like to

98
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.805
rotate and translate to at one,

99
00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:18.910
two and pi over 2.

100
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.740
First, we should
rotate each point in

101
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.905
the footprint about
the origin by pi over two.

102
00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:27.650
Doing so, gives us
new grid points at zero,

103
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.425
zero, zero, one, and zero, two.

104
00:04:30.425 --> 00:04:33.035
To complete the footprint
transformation,

105
00:04:33.035 --> 00:04:35.630
we then translate
it by one and two.

106
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.105
Doing so, gives us
the final grid points;

107
00:04:38.105 --> 00:04:41.360
one, two, one, three,
and one, four.

108
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.920
Recall that the order of

109
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.140
the steps in this
transformation matters.

110
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.880
If we first translated and

111
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.620
then rotate it about the origin,

112
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.404
we would get
an incorrect location

113
00:04:50.404 --> 00:04:52.265
for the transformed points.

114
00:04:52.265 --> 00:04:55.460
To get the actual
occupancy grid index,

115
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.959
we offset the x and y points
by the capital x and y,

116
00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:01.670
which are the sizes of the x and

117
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.580
y dimensions of the
occupancy grid respectively.

118
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.090
We can then divide this by
the grid resolution delta

119
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.660
to get the associated indices
in the occupancy grid.

120
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.395
We then add each of these points
to a set data structure.

121
00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:17.075
Since we are maintaining a set,

122
00:05:17.075 --> 00:05:18.350
we are ensuring that there are

123
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.675
no duplicate points in our swath.

124
00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:21.980
As you can imagine,

125
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.570
this computation becomes quite

126
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.730
expensive as the problem scales,

127
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.870
which makes it difficult to

128
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.245
use when performing
real-time planning.

129
00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:32.300
In addition, using
the exact footprint when

130
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.860
calculating the swath can be

131
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.575
dangerous due to
our imperfect information,

132
00:05:36.575 --> 00:05:40.685
as there is no buffer for
errors in obstacle positions.

133
00:05:40.685 --> 00:05:42.890
Because this swath-based method

134
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.125
is often computationally
expensive,

135
00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:46.880
it is often useful when we are

136
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.190
exploiting a lot of repetition

137
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.870
in our motion planning algorithm

138
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.065
as in the case in
lattice planners.

139
00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:57.110
Since we are constrained
to a small set of

140
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.860
control actions each step
of a lattice planner,

141
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.200
we are also constrained
to a small set of swaths,

142
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.245
so their union can be
pre-computed offline.

143
00:06:06.245 --> 00:06:08.959
When performing collision
checking online,

144
00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:12.395
the problem reduces to
multiple array lookups.

145
00:06:12.395 --> 00:06:15.265
To help mitigate
both the challenge of

146
00:06:15.265 --> 00:06:16.900
imperfect information and

147
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.055
extensive computation
requirements,

148
00:06:19.055 --> 00:06:21.790
we often use conservative
approximations

149
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:22.945
to collision checking,

150
00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:27.220
sacrificing optimality to
improve speed and robustness.

151
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.190
In this context,
optimality is defined by

152
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.215
your selection of an
appropriate objective function,

153
00:06:33.215 --> 00:06:37.040
some of which we discussed
earlier in this course.

154
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.820
Since we switched to approximate

155
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.370
collision checking to gain
computing performance,

156
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.180
we must use approximations
that are overly conservative.

157
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.815
The goal in selecting

158
00:06:47.815 --> 00:06:50.350
a particular approximation
is to find one

159
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.820
that offers great algorithmic

160
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.325
speed-up without
compromising safety,

161
00:06:54.325 --> 00:06:56.630
but also minimizing the degree to

162
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.435
which our trajectories
become sub-optimal.

163
00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:02.300
What do we mean by
conservative approximation

164
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.560
to collision checking?

165
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.015
In this context,

166
00:07:05.015 --> 00:07:06.680
a conservative approximation

167
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.910
to collision checking would be

168
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.965
one that may report a collision

169
00:07:09.965 --> 00:07:12.410
along a path even
if there isn't one,

170
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.600
but will never report
no collision along

171
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.480
a path if one does
actually occur.

172
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.190
For a concrete example,

173
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.845
suppose we have
a car as shown here.

174
00:07:21.845 --> 00:07:23.600
Now suppose we replaced

175
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.890
the cars footprint with
overlapping circles.

176
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.240
The overlapping
circles completely

177
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.330
encompass the footprint of
the cars rectangular body,

178
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.550
which means the
footprint of the car is

179
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.135
a subset of the footprint of
all three circles combined.

180
00:07:38.135 --> 00:07:40.750
No matter what
trajectory we follow,

181
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.490
the swath generated by
the rectangle will be

182
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.915
a subset of the swath

183
00:07:44.915 --> 00:07:47.450
generated by
the overlapping circles.

184
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.370
Why is this conservative?

185
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.160
Suppose we have
an obstacle inside

186
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.870
the circle footprints but not
inside the car footprint,

187
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.090
this would result in
a location being reported

188
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.425
by the collision checker

189
00:08:00.425 --> 00:08:02.810
even though one wouldn't
actually occur.

190
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.410
However, if an obstacle lies
outside of the circles,

191
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.310
no collision will be detected
and none will occur.

192
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.390
This means that
the collision checker may

193
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.864
contain some false
positive collisions,

194
00:08:13.864 --> 00:08:16.685
but will not contain
a false negative.

195
00:08:16.685 --> 00:08:18.830
This results in a nice buffer

196
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.570
for our car that helps alleviate

197
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.950
the issues presented by

198
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.080
the imperfect information
provided to us.

199
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:29.509
This circle approximation is
useful for some algorithms

200
00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.700
because it is
computationally cheap to

201
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.100
check if a point lies
within a circle.

202
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.870
All we need to do is check if

203
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.060
the distance between
any of the points of

204
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.860
the obstacle and the center of

205
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.190
the circle is less than
the radius of the circle.

206
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.340
For example, the position
of this pylon

207
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.870
from the center of the circle is

208
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.565
less than the radius
of the circle,

209
00:08:49.565 --> 00:08:51.595
so collision would be reported.

210
00:08:51.595 --> 00:08:54.030
However, for the second circle,

211
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.930
the pylon lies outside
the radius of the circle,

212
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.330
which would result in
this particular section of

213
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.435
the path of the car being
free from collision.

214
00:09:02.435 --> 00:09:05.750
If the occupancy grid is
implemented such that it can

215
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.130
provide the distance to

216
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.620
the nearest object
at each grid point,

217
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.330
this can be a simple lookup in

218
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.130
an array which is extremely

219
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.600
efficient relative to checking

220
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.600
for arbitrary polygon
intersections.

221
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.080
One thing to realize about
conservative approximations,

222
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.624
is that they may eliminate

223
00:09:22.624 --> 00:09:25.760
all feasible collision-free
paths from a problem

224
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.445
even though a path exists or

225
00:09:28.445 --> 00:09:31.480
eliminate safe passages
through narrow openings.

226
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.320
This can cause the planner to get

227
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.630
stuck when it
shouldn't or can cause

228
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.845
the planner to compute

229
00:09:36.845 --> 00:09:40.130
a much more circuitous route
than is necessary.

230
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.890
Depending on which motion
planning algorithm you

231
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.760
use and the structure
of your occupancy grid,

232
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.600
different collision
checking algorithms

233
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.505
will be more efficient
than others.

234
00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:52.580
It will be up to you as
an autonomous driving engineer

235
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.510
to decide which algorithm
best suits your application.

236
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.760
One thing to note in all of

237
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.980
these calculations is
that they are all in

238
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.630
discrete form since we are

239
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.180
performing these
computations on a computer.

240
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.615
Therefore, our collision
checking accuracy is also

241
00:10:08.615 --> 00:10:10.880
influenced by
the resolution that we

242
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.970
choose when performing
our discretizations.

243
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.460
To illustrate this,
suppose we have

244
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.650
this same path and footprint

245
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.450
but suppose one swath is

246
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.540
computed with much coarser
resolution than the other.

247
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.720
We can see that
the coarser resolution results

248
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.000
in large gaps in our swath,

249
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.635
which can result in
errors if there are

250
00:10:30.635 --> 00:10:32.515
obstacles at those positions.

251
00:10:32.515 --> 00:10:34.310
The finer the resolution we

252
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.260
choose for our
collision checking,

253
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.240
the more accurate it will be.

254
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.700
However, higher resolution also

255
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.650
incurs a computational cost.

256
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:43.850
So you again, as

257
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.160
an autonomous driving engineer
will need to strike

258
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.495
the right balance between

259
00:10:47.495 --> 00:10:50.090
accuracy and computational speed.

260
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.650
Rest assured, there are

261
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.560
many excellent collision
checking libraries available and

262
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.750
we've included
some useful links for you

263
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.965
to use in the
supplemental materials.

264
00:10:59.965 --> 00:11:02.305
To summarize in this video,

265
00:11:02.305 --> 00:11:04.220
we discussed how we can use

266
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.410
the occupancy grid
developed in module

267
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.290
two to solve the collision
checking problem

268
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.965
using swath-based
collision checking.

269
00:11:11.965 --> 00:11:14.015
As well that we described

270
00:11:14.015 --> 00:11:16.040
the circle based collision
checking method.

271
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.840
We went over some examples to

272
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.700
illustrate these algorithms and

273
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.620
discussed in what situations

274
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.580
each type of collision
checking should be used.

275
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.920
Hopefully, this video has
given you some insight into

276
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.600
how collision checking is done

277
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.780
in an autonomous driving context.

278
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.680
Performing quick and efficient

279
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.420
collision checking
especially with

280
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.460
dynamic obstacles is currently

281
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.380
an area of active research,

282
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.780
and we hope that you too
will help contribute

283
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.815
to solving these challenging
and interesting problems.

284
00:11:44.815 --> 00:11:46.700
In the next video, we will

285
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.070
introduce a reactive
planning algorithm for

286
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.720
this module which is

287
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.420
called the Trajectory
Rollout algorithm.

288
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.400
It will combine
the collision checking

289
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.320
approach we've
developed here with

290
00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.490
the concepts covered in

291
00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:02.280
the trajectory propagation
lesson. See you then.
