00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.200
Hello everyone. Welcome to

2
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.110
the first module of our
motion planning course.

3
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.410
In this module, you
will learn about

4
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.230
the motion planning problem
in autonomous driving.

5
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.690
The motion planning
problem is the task

6
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.790
of navigating the ego vehicle to

7
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.760
its destination in
a safe and comfortable manner

8
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.025
while following
the rules of the road.

9
00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:43.415
As discussed in the first course
of this specialization,

10
00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:45.725
this task can be decomposed

11
00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:48.605
into a hierarchy of
optimization problems.

12
00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:49.970
Each of which will have

13
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.085
different constraints
and objectives.

14
00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.840
By the end of this module,

15
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.430
you should have
an understanding of

16
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.320
the types of subproblems
that need to

17
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.060
be solved when performing

18
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.160
motion planning for
autonomous driving.

19
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.540
In this video, we will

20
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.940
discuss the autonomous
driving mission.

21
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.630
Some of the most prevalent
on-road driving scenarios,

22
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.840
the required behaviors
to handle each scenario,

23
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.270
and some of the important
edge cases that

24
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.010
highlight the challenges of

25
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.605
motion planning for
autonomous driving.

26
00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:21.770
Specifically by
the end of this video,

27
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.780
you will understand
what the goal of

28
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.020
autonomous driving motion
planning missions is,

29
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.430
identify some important
on-road driving scenarios,

30
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.444
and identify some useful
driving behaviors

31
00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:36.400
to handle these scenarios.

32
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.875
First, let's discuss
the autonomous driving mission.

33
00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.275
At a high level,
the autonomous driving mission

34
00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:44.845
is to get from
point A to point B.

35
00:01:44.845 --> 00:01:47.330
The autonomous
driving mission views

36
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.475
this from a navigation
perspective,

37
00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.110
where we need to navigate from

38
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.660
one point on a map
or current position,

39
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.110
to another point corresponding
to our final destination.

40
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.810
In doing so, it should
take the connection of

41
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.920
different streets and

42
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.425
their associated traffic
into consideration.

43
00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:05.930
In order to find
the most efficient path in

44
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.935
the road network in terms
of travel time or distance.

45
00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:12.740
Planning for an autonomous
driving mission

46
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.150
abstracts many of

47
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.000
the important lower-level
variables away from

48
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.410
the problem in order to

49
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.975
simplify the mission
planning process.

50
00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:23.420
However,these lower
level variables such

51
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.650
as roads structures, obstacles,

52
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.195
and other agents on the road,

53
00:02:27.195 --> 00:02:28.880
are crucial to the autonomous

54
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.785
driving motion planning problem.

55
00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:32.510
These lower level variables

56
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.835
defined different
driving scenarios.

57
00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:36.350
We have discussed some of

58
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.795
the driving scenarios
already in Course 1.

59
00:02:38.795 --> 00:02:41.750
So this will serve as
a refresher and will help put

60
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.340
these scenarios into
emotion planning context.

61
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.440
First, let's introduce
some common scenarios

62
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.180
related to the road structure.

63
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.060
By road structure, we mean
the lane boundaries and

64
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.720
the regulatory elements that
are relevant to the driver.

65
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.440
The simplest scenario when
driving is simply driving in

66
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.875
a lane and this is often
called lane maintenance.

67
00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:05.360
In the nominal case,

68
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.800
this is when the car follows

69
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.755
the central line of
it's current lane.

70
00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:11.450
In this scenario,
our goal is to minimize

71
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.780
our deviation from the center
line of the path as well

72
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.480
as reaching our reference
speed which is often

73
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.740
the speed limit to

74
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.115
ensure efficient travel
to our destination.

75
00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:25.190
A more complex scenario
would be when the car

76
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.635
has to perform a lane
change maneuver.

77
00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:29.870
Even when there are
no dynamic obstacles

78
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.230
present in either lane,

79
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.530
we will need to
optimize the shape of

80
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.480
the lane change trajectory within

81
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.885
the constraints of lateral and
longitudinal acceleration.

82
00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.640
The speed limit of the road,

83
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.945
and the time horizon for
execution of the maneuver.

84
00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:46.010
Clearly, all of these parameters

85
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.855
will affect the shape
of the trajectory,

86
00:03:47.855 --> 00:03:50.765
resulting in either slow
passive lane changes,

87
00:03:50.765 --> 00:03:54.445
or more aggressive less
comfortable lane changes.

88
00:03:54.445 --> 00:03:56.785
The third common scenario,

89
00:03:56.785 --> 00:04:00.050
is when the car needs to
perform a left or right turn.

90
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.550
This is often required when

91
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.400
the autonomous car has
to handle intersections.

92
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.260
As with the lane change,

93
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.375
the shape and
aggressiveness of the turn

94
00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:11.120
will vary depending
on the situation.

95
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.550
In addition, the feasibility

96
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.200
of actions and autonomous vehicle

97
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.030
can take is affected

98
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.505
by the state of
the surrounding environment.

99
00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:23.240
For example, the autonomous
vehicle cannot perform

100
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.025
a left turn at a red light

101
00:04:25.025 --> 00:04:27.870
even if the
intersection is clear.

102
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.110
As a final example,

103
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.330
we have a U-turn.

104
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.934
Which is important for
navigating certain scenarios

105
00:04:33.934 --> 00:04:36.860
where the car needs to change
direction efficiently.

106
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.870
As with a lane change and

107
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.090
both the right turn
and left turns,

108
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.800
that you U-turn will
have parameters that

109
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.080
affect the shape
of the trajectory.

110
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.615
The U-turn is also
highly dependent

111
00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:50.030
on the state of
the surrounding environment,

112
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.790
as it is not always legal
to perform a U-turn at

113
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.695
an intersection depending on
your home countries laws.

114
00:04:56.695 --> 00:04:59.140
Now, road structure is not

115
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.660
the only factor in
on-road scenarios.

116
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.850
Static and dynamic obstacles will

117
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.160
dramatically change
both the structure of

118
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.040
the scenario as well
as the difficulty in

119
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.500
determining the required
behavior for a scenario.

120
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.890
In the language of
autonomous driving,

121
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.530
dynamic obstacles are
defined as moving

122
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.800
agents in the planning workspace
of the ego vehicle.

123
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.370
In contrast, static obstacles
or obstacles that are

124
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.165
not moving such as parked cars,
medians, and curves.

125
00:05:28.165 --> 00:05:31.375
Static obstacles
restrict which locations

126
00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:33.355
the autonomous car can occupy

127
00:05:33.355 --> 00:05:35.995
as it plans paths
to its destination.

128
00:05:35.995 --> 00:05:38.180
This is because the car occupies

129
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.310
space as it travels
along its path.

130
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.280
If this overlaps
with an obstacle,

131
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.600
our plan will obviously
results in a collision.

132
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.890
On the other hand,
dynamic obstacles have

133
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.180
a larger impact on

134
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.940
our velocity profile
and driving behavior.

135
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.350
A common example in

136
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.300
driving is when there
is a lead vehicle

137
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.830
in front of our car while we

138
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.810
are performing lane maintenance.

139
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.490
Clearly, this vehicle will have

140
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.440
an impact on our decision-making.

141
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.870
Let's say this car is
going 10 kilometers

142
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.270
per hour slower than
our reference speed.

143
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.520
If we maintain
our current reference speed,

144
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.145
we will eventually hit
the leading vehicle.

145
00:06:13.145 --> 00:06:15.395
Ideally, we would
like to maintain

146
00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:18.850
a time gap between ourselves
and the lead vehicle which

147
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.830
is defined as the amount
of time until we reach

148
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.079
the lead vehicles
current position

149
00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:26.690
while maintaining
our current speed.

150
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.615
So now we have
two competing interests.

151
00:06:29.615 --> 00:06:31.370
We want to stay as close

152
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.574
to our reference
speed as possible,

153
00:06:33.574 --> 00:06:35.915
while maintaining
a time gap between

154
00:06:35.915 --> 00:06:39.020
our car and the lead
vehicle for safety.

155
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.855
Dynamic obstacles
will also affect

156
00:06:41.855 --> 00:06:44.315
our turn and lane
change scenarios.

157
00:06:44.315 --> 00:06:46.495
Depending on their
location and speed,

158
00:06:46.495 --> 00:06:49.850
there may only be certain time
windows of opportunity for

159
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.675
the ego vehicle to execute
each of these maneuvers.

160
00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:56.990
These windows will be estimates
as they will be based on

161
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.625
predictions of all other agents
in the environment.

162
00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:02.345
An example of this,

163
00:07:02.345 --> 00:07:04.480
is when we are waiting
for an intersection to

164
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.045
be clear before
performing a left turn.

165
00:07:07.045 --> 00:07:10.120
The behaviors that are
autonomous vehicle decides to

166
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.160
execute will depend heavily

167
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.440
on the behavior of
oncoming traffic.

168
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.840
If there are
nearby oncoming vehicles

169
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.910
that are moving
quickly towards us,

170
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.000
then the only safe behavior
would be to yield to them.

171
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.340
However, if there is
a longer distance

172
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.960
between the autonomous vehicles
and oncoming traffic,

173
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.080
the autonomous vehicle
will have a window of

174
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.675
opportunity to perform its turn.

175
00:07:31.675 --> 00:07:35.200
Now, not all dynamic obstacles
are cars as there

176
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.250
are other types such as

177
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.480
cyclists, trucks,
and pedestrians.

178
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.795
Each of them will have
their own behaviors

179
00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:43.360
and have their own rules
to follow on the road.

180
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.020
As you've seen throughout

181
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.970
this specialization
even though we've

182
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.725
only defined the most likely

183
00:07:48.725 --> 00:07:50.930
core components of
the driving task,

184
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.600
there's clearly
a rich and diverse set

185
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.755
of potential scenarios
that need to be handled.

186
00:07:56.755 --> 00:07:59.690
Despite this complexity,
the majority of

187
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.880
behaviors for
these scenarios can be

188
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.415
thought of as
a simple composition

189
00:08:04.415 --> 00:08:07.475
of high-level actions
or maneuvers.

190
00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:08.990
An example set of

191
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.965
these high-level maneuvers
would be speed tracking,

192
00:08:11.965 --> 00:08:15.300
deceleration to stop,
staying stopped,

193
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.490
yielding, and emergency stopping.

194
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.390
Let's dig into what each of

195
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.840
these high-level actions
really mean.

196
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.675
Speed tracking is
the nominal driving behavior.

197
00:08:26.675 --> 00:08:29.360
We have a reference speed
or speed limit and we

198
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.795
maintain that speed while
moving forward in our lane.

199
00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:36.515
Decelerating to stop is
pretty self-explanatory.

200
00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:38.180
If we have a stop sign ahead,

201
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.830
we need to smoothly slow down

202
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.185
to a stop to maintain comfort.

203
00:08:42.185 --> 00:08:44.330
Staying stopped is required

204
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.160
for certain regulatory elements.

205
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.540
If we were at a red light,

206
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.815
then we need to remain stopped

207
00:08:48.815 --> 00:08:50.735
until the light turns green.

208
00:08:50.735 --> 00:08:54.740
Yielding is also required for
some regulatory elements.

209
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.230
Most notably, if
we're at a yield sign

210
00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.050
and there's traffic that has
higher precedence than us,

211
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.580
we need to slow down and

212
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.210
wait until it is clear
for us to proceed.

213
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.040
Finally, emergency stops occur

214
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.420
when an issue is detected by

215
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.460
the autonomous car
and the vehicle needs

216
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.560
to stop immediately
and pull over.

217
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.670
These high-level
behaviors can also be

218
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.980
augmented by
navigational behaviors,

219
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.875
such as performing
lane changes and turns.

220
00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:23.840
By bringing all of this together,

221
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.855
we can now cover the most
basic driving scenarios.

222
00:09:26.855 --> 00:09:29.840
While this set of maneuvers
has good coverage,

223
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.030
it is important to
note that this list of

224
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.610
behaviors is in
no way exhaustive and

225
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.380
that there are
many ways to increase

226
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.090
behavioral complexity to handle

227
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.705
evermore interesting scenarios.

228
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.630
In terms of the set
of driving scenarios,

229
00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.145
we've really only begun
to scratch the surface.

230
00:09:46.145 --> 00:09:49.220
There are many unusual
instances that make

231
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.690
the autonomous driving problem

232
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.835
and extremely challenging task.

233
00:09:52.835 --> 00:09:54.560
For example, suppose that you

234
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.050
have a jaywalking pedestrian,

235
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.540
we would then have an agent
violating their rules of

236
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.475
the road which makes
their behavior

237
00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:04.295
unpredictable from a motion
planning perspective.

238
00:10:04.295 --> 00:10:05.930
Another example, is when

239
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.390
a motorcyclist performs
lane splitting,

240
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.440
which may or may not be

241
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.330
legal depending on
your home country.

242
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.720
This behavior can be confusing
for an autonomous car,

243
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.940
which often uses the
lane boundaries to

244
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.270
inform the predictions of
other agents on the road.

245
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.160
As you can see, solving

246
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.805
the motion planning
problem is a complex task.

247
00:10:24.805 --> 00:10:27.650
To solve for the optimal
motion plan without

248
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.950
any forms of selective
abstraction and simplification,

249
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.155
would simply be intractable.

250
00:10:33.155 --> 00:10:36.200
To remedy this, we
instead break the task

251
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.680
up into a hierarchy of
optimization problems.

252
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.880
By doing this, we can tailor
the inputs and outputs of

253
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.700
each optimization problem
to the correct level of

254
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.770
abstraction which will allow us

255
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.410
to perform motion
planning in real-time.

256
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.830
In this hierarchy, higher
in the hierarchy means that

257
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.270
the optimization problem is

258
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.865
at a higher level of abstraction.

259
00:10:58.865 --> 00:11:02.750
At the top of this hierarchy
is mission planning,

260
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.220
which focuses on solving

261
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.930
the autonomous driving mission of

262
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.790
navigating to our destination at

263
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.595
the map level which
we discussed earlier.

264
00:11:10.595 --> 00:11:13.420
Next, we have the behavior
planning problem.

265
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.245
Which decides which behaviors

266
00:11:15.245 --> 00:11:16.460
the autonomous vehicles should

267
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.775
take depending on
its current driving scenario.

268
00:11:19.775 --> 00:11:21.440
Based on that maneuver,

269
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.019
we then use the local
planner to calculate

270
00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:25.430
a collision-free path and

271
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.640
velocity profile to
the required goal state.

272
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.940
In our case, we will
decouple this process into

273
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.954
path planning and velocity
profile generation

274
00:11:34.954 --> 00:11:36.770
to improve performance.

275
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.400
Finally, our computed motion
plan will be given to

276
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.020
the controllers to track

277
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.990
which we've designed
in the first course.

278
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.660
Each of these optimization
problems will have

279
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.080
different objectives and
constraints used to solve it.

280
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.125
Which we will be discussing
in the coming lessons.

281
00:11:54.125 --> 00:11:55.730
Now that we've gone through

282
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.714
our introduction to
these motion planning problems,

283
00:11:58.714 --> 00:12:02.200
let's summarize what we've
discussed in this video.

284
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.940
We've identified
the autonomous driving

285
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.235
motion planning mission
as the problem

286
00:12:07.235 --> 00:12:09.110
of navigating from
the ego vehicles

287
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.260
current position to
a required destination.

288
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.940
We've also looked at

289
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.090
some common on-road
driving scenarios and how

290
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.280
the road structure as
well as the obstacles

291
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.340
present dictate the nature
of the scenario.

292
00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.580
We then discussed some useful
driving behaviors

293
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.325
to navigate the scenarios
we've identified.

294
00:12:28.325 --> 00:12:31.130
Finally, we've
described a hierarchy

295
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.550
of motion planning
optimization problems.

296
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.360
Which we will discuss in detail

297
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.925
throughout the remainder
of this course.

298
00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:39.710
Hopefully this lesson
has given you

299
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.560
some insight into the different
scenarios that you as

300
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.810
an autonomy engineer
will encounter when

301
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.245
designing a motion planner
for an autonomous vehicle.

302
00:12:48.245 --> 00:12:50.150
The key takeaway here is

303
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.950
that while we've
enumerated many of

304
00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.150
the basic scenarios and

305
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.625
behaviors required for
autonomous driving,

306
00:12:55.625 --> 00:12:58.850
there are still many open
questions about how to plan

307
00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.830
safe and robust behaviors

308
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:04.040
across all potential
driving scenarios.

309
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.720
In our next lesson,

310
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.970
we'll explore some common
constraints that you will

311
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.340
encounter when solving
the motion planning,

312
00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:15.480
optimization subproblems in
our hierarchy. See you then.
