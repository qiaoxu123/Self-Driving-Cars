00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.460
Hi everyone, and welcome
to lesson three.

2
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.320
In this video, we will explore

3
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.270
some of the objective
functions most

4
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.710
commonly used in

5
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.060
the autonomous driving motion

6
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.725
planning problem formulation.

7
00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.410
In this context, the
objective function of

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.450
our motion planning
problem gives us

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.910
a way of scoring
our current motion plan,

10
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.740
and allows us to optimize

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.090
the motion plans such that

12
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.535
it has desirable characteristics.

13
00:00:38.535 --> 00:00:40.450
After completing this lesson,

14
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.810
you'll be able to list

15
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.760
some useful objective
functions that

16
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.330
can be used in motion planning
for autonomous driving.

17
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.895
You will also understand
the benefits that

18
00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:51.620
each objective function offers

19
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.225
to the motion planning process.

20
00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:55.180
So let's get started.

21
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.640
When performing path planning,

22
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.530
the simplest and most intuitive
goal is that we would

23
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.830
like to reach our destination
as efficiently as possible.

24
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.140
In the path planning
context this,

25
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.179
often translates to minimizing

26
00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:10.985
the arc length of the
path that we're planning.

27
00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:12.495
What is the arc length?

28
00:01:12.495 --> 00:01:15.200
Intuitively, the
arc length of the path is

29
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.120
the total accumulated distance

30
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.410
the car will travel as
it traverses the path.

31
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.310
In many cases, the path will be

32
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.035
parameterized by arc length.

33
00:01:24.035 --> 00:01:25.700
So this can be formulated as

34
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.820
a penalty term proportional
to the arc length.

35
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.295
In other cases, we
will have to solve an

36
00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:33.320
integral numerically to calculate

37
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.865
the arc length of a path.

38
00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:36.470
The general arc length

39
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.850
integral is shown here
in the first equation,

40
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.410
where Sf is the total
accumulated arc length,

41
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.470
Xi is the starting x
coordinate of the path,

42
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.055
and Xf is the end x
coordinate of the path.

43
00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:50.980
By minimizing arc length,

44
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.970
we are computing
the shortest path

45
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.380
from our current location,

46
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.705
through our required destination.

47
00:01:56.705 --> 00:01:59.700
When optimizing a
velocity profile,

48
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.460
time to destination is

49
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.935
often the objective we
would like to minimize.

50
00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:05.510
In terms of arc length,

51
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.210
this is the same as
integrating the inverse of

52
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.370
the longitudinal velocity over

53
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.890
the path as a function
of arc length.

54
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.100
Intuitively, this is
equivalent to dividing

55
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.750
the total distance by

56
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.170
the velocity traveled along
the curve at each point.

57
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.800
Except since the velocity
changes along the path,

58
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.930
we formulate it as an integral.

59
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.380
This integral is given
in the second equation,

60
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.545
where Tf is the total time
of the profile.

61
00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:35.480
By minimizing this integral,

62
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.640
we are minimizing
the time to reach

63
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.685
the destination while following
a given planned path.

64
00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:43.900
As an example, let's look at

65
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.370
two possible paths between

66
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.890
the same start and end locations.

67
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.930
The first path clearly has

68
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.300
a longer arc length
than the second path,

69
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.890
and is therefore
less efficient at

70
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.245
the task of reaching
its destination.

71
00:02:56.245 --> 00:02:58.390
We can see that even
though they have

72
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.970
the same initial
and final states,

73
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.770
the second path will result in

74
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.890
a lower value of the arc length
objective function,

75
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.755
which suits are driving
task more favorably.

76
00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:12.010
Now, in path planning
for autonomous driving,

77
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.190
we may be given a reference path
we'd like to follow.

78
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.980
In many cases, this
will be given to us by

79
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.980
our mapping module as
the center line of a length,

80
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.440
or the required path for
a turn in an intersection.

81
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.880
To ensure that we follow

82
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.249
the reference path as
closely as possible,

83
00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:29.990
we include what is known as

84
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.805
an integral of difference term,

85
00:03:31.805 --> 00:03:33.580
or IOD for short.

86
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.710
Essentially, it
penalizes deviations

87
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.515
from the input
reference path Xref,

88
00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:41.810
as we traverse
are calculated path

89
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.260
as shown in the first equation.

90
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.350
Similarly, when performing
velocity profile optimization,

91
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.880
we often want to minimize

92
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.160
the difference between
our velocity profiles

93
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.540
speed throughout the path with
some reference speed Vref,

94
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.195
whether it will be
the speed limit

95
00:03:58.195 --> 00:04:00.060
or determined otherwise.

96
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.735
This is shown in
the second equation.

97
00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:04.910
While this can be formulated as

98
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.815
an absolute difference penalty,

99
00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:09.770
it is often the case
that we want to penalize

100
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.390
exceeding speed limits more

101
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.865
harshly than staying
below the speed limit.

102
00:04:13.865 --> 00:04:16.520
So we may add what is
called a hinge loss

103
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.210
term to our objective shown
in the third equation.

104
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.180
Essentially, this term is only

105
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.640
active when the velocity profile
exceeds the speed limit,

106
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.640
that is when
the difference between

107
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.400
our speed and the speed
limit is positive,

108
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.665
otherwise this term is zero.

109
00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:35.360
This allows us to penalize

110
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.510
speed limit violations more
harshly while still allowing

111
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.790
us to encourage
the autonomous vehicle

112
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.345
to reach its required
reference velocity.

113
00:04:44.345 --> 00:04:46.730
The next objective we'd like to

114
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.000
tackle is rides smoothness.

115
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.410
Recall from the previous lesson
that in order to

116
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.660
maintain stability and comfort,

117
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.050
we constrained our maximum
acceleration magnitude.

118
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.210
When optimizing comfort in

119
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.765
the objective function
of our velocity profile,

120
00:05:01.765 --> 00:05:03.800
we instead turn our focus to

121
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.950
minimizing the jerk
along our trajectory.

122
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.560
What is jerk? We're
not referring to

123
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.140
that of noxious driver
that you just cut off.

124
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.300
Jerk is the rate of change of

125
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.310
acceleration with
respect to time,

126
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.070
or the third derivative
of position.

127
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.160
The jerk along the car's
trajectory greatly

128
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.340
impacts the user's comfort
while in the car.

129
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.500
So when planning
our velocity profile,

130
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.460
we would like to keep
the accumulated absolute value

131
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.615
of jerk as small as possible,

132
00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:35.275
shown here by this integral.

133
00:05:35.275 --> 00:05:37.550
Let's look at an example of

134
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.560
two different velocity profiles.

135
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.350
On the left is
a linear ramp profile

136
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.025
which maximizes jerk at the
start and end of the profile.

137
00:05:46.025 --> 00:05:48.350
This is shown in
the large spikes in

138
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.990
the jerk at the start
and end of our plot.

139
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.260
For passengers, this can
be quite uncomfortable.

140
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.880
If we compare this with

141
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.270
a bi quadratic profile
as seen on the right,

142
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.030
We can see that there are
no jerk spikes which will

143
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.480
result in a much smoother
ride for the passengers.

144
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.640
Because of this
difference in comfort,

145
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.920
it is important to
choose profiles that

146
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.055
reduce jerk that passengers
feel when possible.

147
00:06:13.055 --> 00:06:15.410
Now, when planning paths,

148
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.305
we have to be mindful that
the structure of our path

149
00:06:18.305 --> 00:06:22.220
will impact the comfort of
our velocity profile as well.

150
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.620
Recall from the
previous lesson that

151
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.870
paths with high
curvature constrained

152
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.510
the maximum velocity
along the path to

153
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.250
a low value in order to

154
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.070
remain within the friction
ellipse of the vehicle.

155
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.260
To ensure that we avoid points

156
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.420
of high curvature along our path,

157
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.680
we need to formulate

158
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.655
some penalty for
large absolute curvature values,

159
00:06:43.655 --> 00:06:46.940
and objective function that
is commonly used to represent

160
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.080
this penalty is known as
the bending energy of the path.

161
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.410
Essentially, it is
the square curvature

162
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.180
integrated along the path,

163
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.090
where once again Kappa
denotes the curvature.

164
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.060
This objective
distributes the curvature

165
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.875
more evenly along the path,

166
00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:06.320
preventing any one
along the path from

167
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.200
reaching too high a
total curvature value.

168
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.600
As an example, in this path,

169
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.930
we have a path planned
for a left turn

170
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.360
with quite a harsh bend before
reaching the goal state.

171
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.330
According to our bending
energy objective,

172
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.670
this will be highly
penalized as there is

173
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.265
a point of peaks
curvature along the path.

174
00:07:25.265 --> 00:07:28.430
If we were to plan a
velocity profile for this path,

175
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.140
we would need to decelerate

176
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.915
greatly by the time we reached
the bend in the curve.

177
00:07:32.915 --> 00:07:35.180
Otherwise we would
sacrifice comfort of

178
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.360
our passengers and potentially
even vehicle stability.

179
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.460
If we instead look at
the path on the right,

180
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.010
we have a path for
a left turn with

181
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.325
a more widely distributed
lower overall curvature.

182
00:07:49.325 --> 00:07:52.740
This will result in a smoother
more comfortable term,

183
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.500
and will allow us to maintain

184
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.300
a reasonable speed while still

185
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.355
staying within
the comfort rectangle

186
00:07:58.355 --> 00:08:01.325
when optimizing
our velocity profile.

187
00:08:01.325 --> 00:08:03.830
Now that we've gone
through a variety of

188
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.770
objective functions
for motion planning,

189
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.010
let's take some time to

190
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.515
summarize what we've
discussed in this video.

191
00:08:09.515 --> 00:08:11.030
We first discussed

192
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.865
objective functions
related to efficiency,

193
00:08:13.865 --> 00:08:15.410
and also discussed how they

194
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.755
reduce path length
and transit time.

195
00:08:18.755 --> 00:08:21.830
We discussed how to
encourage trajectories

196
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.845
to track reference paths
and velocity profiles,

197
00:08:24.845 --> 00:08:27.560
as well as how to
improve comfort along

198
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.090
a given trajectory by

199
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.045
penalizing high-path
curvature and jerk.

200
00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:35.780
By now, you should have
a general idea of some types of

201
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.550
objective functions
you will need to

202
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.030
consider when optimizing paths
and trajectories.

203
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.450
When designing an over-arching
objective function,

204
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.950
each of these terms will need to

205
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.870
be combined into one function,

206
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.745
often as a weighted sum.

207
00:08:49.745 --> 00:08:52.010
The particular
combination of weights

208
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.140
you choose is
an engineering decision,

209
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.345
and you will need to
fine tune your choice

210
00:08:56.345 --> 00:08:58.880
depending on
a specific application.

211
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.880
Of course, we have only
scratched the surface on

212
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.930
a rich topic of

213
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.185
optimization objectives for
path and trajectory planning.

214
00:09:06.185 --> 00:09:07.640
As you progress as

215
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.560
an autonomy engineer I'm
sure you'll be able to

216
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.960
come up with interesting
and useful objectives

217
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.130
functions yourself.

218
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.600
In our next video,

219
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.670
we will discuss ways to decouple

220
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.410
the motion planning problem into

221
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.440
simpler and smaller sub-problems,

222
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.940
as well as outline
different approaches to

223
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.450
solving each sub-problem.
See you there.
