00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.840
Welcome back. In this video,

2
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.279
we'll discuss some of
the most important constraints

3
00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.080
involved in motion planning.

4
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.200
These constraints are often
crucial for maintaining

5
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.050
stability and comfort
within the vehicle,

6
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.910
as well as maintaining
the safety of

7
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.430
all agents in
a given driving scenario.

8
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.000
Specifically, you will
learn about how the vehicle

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.680
kinematic and dynamic models

10
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.560
constrain our motion
planning for the vehicle.

11
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.120
You will learn about

12
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.100
how static and dynamic obstacles

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.325
impact our vehicle
motion planning.

14
00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:46.910
Finally, you will see how

15
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.400
regulatory elements
impact the behaviors

16
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.990
available to us during

17
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.520
the motion planning process.
Let's get started.

18
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.490
The first of the motion
planning constraints we will

19
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.415
work with is related to
the vehicle kinematics.

20
00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:02.710
In motion planning for
autonomous driving,

21
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.890
as we have discussed
in course one,

22
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.600
the kinematics for
the ego vehicle are often

23
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.250
simplified to what is known as

24
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.590
the kinematic bicycle model.

25
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.730
One reason why this model is
chosen is that bicycles have

26
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.250
a range of acceptable
steering angle values

27
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.770
similar to a car.

28
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.630
For a fixed velocity V,

29
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.680
this range of steering
angle values and

30
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.400
delta corresponds to a range
of admissible curvatures,

31
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.695
kappa that the vehicle
can follow.

32
00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:31.540
This means that when performing

33
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.120
motion planning while
using the bicycle model,

34
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.640
there is a maximum magnitude
of curvature that can be

35
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.610
executed when
traversing a given path

36
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.740
denoted by kappa max.

37
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.545
The same holds for
autonomous cars.

38
00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:48.500
This means that
the curvature of any path we

39
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.360
plan needs to be mindful
of this maximum curvature.

40
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.650
Unfortunately, this
is what's known

41
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.095
as a non-holonomic constraint.

42
00:01:57.095 --> 00:01:59.900
Intuitively, this means
that the constraint

43
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.960
doesn't depend on
the only the state of the robot,

44
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.710
but also on how the robot
got to its current state.

45
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.680
Non-holonomic constraints
reduce the number of

46
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.480
directions a robot can take

47
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.700
at any given point
in its workspace.

48
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.400
In general, non-holonomic
constraints

49
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.060
make the planning problem
much more complex.

50
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.815
Now you may be wondering
how does curvature

51
00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:25.715
impact the shape of a given path
in our motion plan.

52
00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:28.160
To give you an
intuitive understanding

53
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.410
of what curvature is,

54
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.015
here we have an arbitrary curve.

55
00:02:32.015 --> 00:02:34.240
For each point along the path,

56
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.920
we can fit a circle to
that point based on

57
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.320
the instantaneous rates
of change of

58
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.170
the curve in space at
that particular point.

59
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.910
This is analogous to the idea

60
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.470
of the instantaneous center of

61
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.000
rotation we use to

62
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.580
derive the bicycle model
in the first place.

63
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.650
Based on the shape of the plot,

64
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.400
it appears different points
are more curvy than others.

65
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.920
So, our intuition should
be the different points

66
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.925
along the curve will have
different curvatures.

67
00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:02.945
For example, here we have

68
00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:06.245
a circle fit to a particular
point on the curve.

69
00:03:06.245 --> 00:03:10.160
As you can see, it has
quite a large radius r,

70
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.810
and intuitive interpretation of

71
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.190
the curvature is that it's

72
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.350
the inverse of
the radius of the circle

73
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.110
fit to that particular point
along the curve.

74
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.660
Since this radius is quite large,

75
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.200
this point has
relatively low curvature,

76
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.220
which can be seen from the plot

77
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.145
as the point has
a more gentle bent.

78
00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:31.850
If instead we look at
a second point on this curve,

79
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.140
we can see that it has

80
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.520
a smaller radius as it compared
to the previous point.

81
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.050
This in turn corresponds
to a point of

82
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.560
higher curvature and can
be seen from the plot,

83
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.165
this point has much more

84
00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:47.150
aggressive bend than
the previous point.

85
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.520
While this circle
fitting approach is

86
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.725
useful as a geometric
interpretation,

87
00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:54.155
a more precise
mathematical formulation

88
00:03:54.155 --> 00:03:56.600
is given here for the curvature.

89
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.490
It can be computed using

90
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.950
the first and second
order derivatives of

91
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.570
the x and y components of

92
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.975
a given path defined with
respect to arc length.

93
00:04:05.975 --> 00:04:09.635
These arc length derivatives
are given by x prime,

94
00:04:09.635 --> 00:04:11.750
y prime, x double prime,

95
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.370
and y double prime.

96
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.070
The next constraint
will be discussing

97
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.905
is derived from
the vehicle dynamics.

98
00:04:18.905 --> 00:04:21.140
These dynamic
constraints focus on

99
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.080
keeping the car in
a stable safe state.

100
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.540
The first of the
dynamics constraints is

101
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.950
imposed by what is called

102
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.140
the friction ellipse of the car.

103
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.140
If you recall, we
discussed tire slip and

104
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.250
the friction ellipse in our

105
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.365
bicycle model during course one.

106
00:04:36.365 --> 00:04:39.920
The friction ellipse denotes
the maximum magnitude of

107
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.840
the friction forces that can be

108
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.915
generated between
a car tire and the road.

109
00:04:44.915 --> 00:04:46.640
If the applied forces of

110
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.015
the car's engine exceed
the friction forces of the tire,

111
00:04:50.015 --> 00:04:52.520
the tires will slip
on the road surface.

112
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.830
The turning functionality
of a vehicle

113
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.770
relies on the tires
gripping the road surface.

114
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.290
So to maintain control
and stability,

115
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.485
the car must remain within
the friction circle.

116
00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:04.880
At the end of the day,

117
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.410
this boils down to lateral

118
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.710
and longitudinal
acceleration constraints.

119
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.870
In general, though the

120
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.060
acceleration constraints
are often much

121
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.590
higher than what is physically

122
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.575
comfortable for the passengers
inside the car.

123
00:05:18.575 --> 00:05:22.070
Therefore, in non-emergency
situations we often

124
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.745
focus on the comfort rectangle
of accelerations.

125
00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:27.530
These values constrain,

126
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.795
the lateral and
longitudinal accelerations

127
00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:32.540
to each lie within
a range of comfort,

128
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.820
denoted on the
longitudinal acceleration

129
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.885
along and lateral
acceleration alat axis.

130
00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:40.585
This is shown here,

131
00:05:40.585 --> 00:05:42.875
where the comfort
rectangle in blue

132
00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:46.385
lies well within the friction
ellipse shown in green.

133
00:05:46.385 --> 00:05:49.040
This results in
a tighter constraint on

134
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.780
the feasible accelerations for

135
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.755
a motion plan than
the friction ellipse requires.

136
00:05:54.755 --> 00:05:57.800
From the lateral
acceleration constraints,

137
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.830
as well as the curvature
of the path,

138
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.469
we have now indirectly

139
00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:03.810
constrained the
velocity of the car.

140
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.470
The velocity of the car V
is a function of

141
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.335
the lateral acceleration
of the car alat,

142
00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:12.080
as well as the instantaneous
turning radius of

143
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.750
the path r. Recall that

144
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.520
the instantaneous curvature along

145
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.840
the path kappa is

146
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.305
the inverse of the turning
radius of the car.

147
00:06:21.305 --> 00:06:23.960
If we now combine
these equations,

148
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.870
we can see that the square
of the velocity is

149
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.065
constrained by the
maximum lateral acceleration,

150
00:06:30.065 --> 00:06:32.914
alat max which is a constant,

151
00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:35.900
as well as the curvature
of the path kappa,

152
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.995
which changes at
each point along the path.

153
00:06:38.995 --> 00:06:42.545
Because of this, it's clear
that when we are generating

154
00:06:42.545 --> 00:06:45.620
a velocity profile for
our autonomous vehicle,

155
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.680
we have to take the curvature
of the path as well as

156
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.005
the vehicles maximum
lateral acceleration

157
00:06:51.005 --> 00:06:53.280
into consideration.

158
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.390
Static obstacles also provide

159
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.060
constraints upon
our path planning process.

160
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.450
Since static obstacles
such as a parked car or

161
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.390
a construction pylon have fixed

162
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.695
positions that do not
change with time,

163
00:07:06.695 --> 00:07:09.140
they are often modeled
by blocking out

164
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.350
certain portions of
the ego vehicles workspace.

165
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.940
This concept will be covered in

166
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.000
greater detail in module
two of this course,

167
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.960
where we discuss
the occupancy grid map.

168
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.930
Essentially, static
obstacles constrain

169
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.270
the locations that a car
can occupy along its path.

170
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.250
There are numerous ways to

171
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.350
perform static
collision checking.

172
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.750
One way is to check the swath of

173
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.900
the vehicle as it travels
along a given path.

174
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.195
This swath is the union of

175
00:07:38.195 --> 00:07:41.540
all positions occupied by
the body of the ego vehicle,

176
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.230
as the ego vehicle
traverses the path.

177
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.450
If the swath overlaps
with a static obstacle,

178
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.085
that path is infeasible.

179
00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:52.190
Another option for
fast collision checking is to

180
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.730
approximate the body of
the car with a set of circles,

181
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.919
and calculate
the circle locations

182
00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:00.170
as the car moves along its path.

183
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.830
If a static obstacle lies
within any of the circles,

184
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.810
then the path is
deemed infeasible.

185
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.910
The union of these circles is

186
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.355
often larger than
the body of the vehicle,

187
00:08:10.355 --> 00:08:13.235
ensuring a conservative
approximation.

188
00:08:13.235 --> 00:08:14.750
We'll be discussing this in

189
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.730
more detail in future lessons.

190
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.380
Dynamic obstacles on
the other hand provides some of

191
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.015
the most challenging constraints

192
00:08:23.015 --> 00:08:25.175
on the motion planning problem.

193
00:08:25.175 --> 00:08:28.085
Different classes of
dynamic obstacles

194
00:08:28.085 --> 00:08:29.445
such as cars, bicycles,

195
00:08:29.445 --> 00:08:31.400
and pedestrians will all

196
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.055
have different behaviors
and motion models.

197
00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:36.920
Constraining our motion plan
based on the behavior of

198
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.215
these other agents will
often involve prediction,

199
00:08:40.215 --> 00:08:42.415
which is subject to uncertainty.

200
00:08:42.415 --> 00:08:45.230
However, if we take
the conservative approach and

201
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.565
constrain ourselves to

202
00:08:46.565 --> 00:08:48.980
all possible behaviors
of all agents,

203
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.080
our motion planning problem
quickly becomes

204
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.605
over-constrained and impossible
to solve meaningfully.

205
00:08:54.605 --> 00:08:58.010
The degree to which we
balance between the safety of

206
00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.169
conservatism and
the aggressiveness

207
00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:02.120
required for forward progress,

208
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.790
is an active area of
autonomous driving research.

209
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.425
As a simple example,

210
00:09:07.425 --> 00:09:09.410
a case where dynamic
obstacles will

211
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.410
constrain our motion will
be at an intersection.

212
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.120
If two cars are entering

213
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.880
the intersection
orthogonal to one another,

214
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.445
then we have a potential
crash scenario.

215
00:09:19.445 --> 00:09:23.030
One way to check for whether
a collision will occur,

216
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.350
is to track the angle

217
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.330
formed by the ego
vehicles direction of

218
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.580
travel and the vector from

219
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.120
the ego vehicles location to
the other agent's location.

220
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.885
If this angle is unchanging
as time progresses,

221
00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:39.080
then the ego vehicle will
collide with the other agent,

222
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.580
and our motion planner
will need to

223
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.640
decelerate to prevent this.

224
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.190
Therefore, the dynamic
obstacle forces us to modify

225
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.810
our behavior based on

226
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.840
how the obstacle proceeds
in our driving scenario.

227
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.290
Another example which we

228
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.940
discussed in
the previous lesson was

229
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.290
when a leading vehicle is

230
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.585
present in front of
the ego vehicle.

231
00:09:59.585 --> 00:10:02.930
This leading vehicle
places an upper constraint

232
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.334
on the ego vehicles
longitudinal velocity,

233
00:10:06.334 --> 00:10:09.110
for if we exceed
their speed while remaining

234
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.170
in the same lane we
will eventually crash.

235
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.660
As you can see,
dynamic obstacles will

236
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.404
constrain both our
behavior planning process,

237
00:10:17.404 --> 00:10:19.400
where we make maneuver decisions,

238
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.665
as well as our local
planning process,

239
00:10:21.665 --> 00:10:24.595
where it will affect
our velocity profile planning.

240
00:10:24.595 --> 00:10:26.300
We will be discussing this in

241
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.450
further detail in
subsequent modules.

242
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.700
The final constraint that we will

243
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.265
discuss encompasses
the rules of the road

244
00:10:34.265 --> 00:10:36.050
as well as the
regulatory elements

245
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.960
present in the ego
vehicles workspace.

246
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.210
While the rules of
the road provides

247
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.350
some constraints to
the planning problem,

248
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.720
they also help us make

249
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.970
informed decisions
about other agents

250
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.725
behaviors in the environment.

251
00:10:48.725 --> 00:10:50.000
For example,

252
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.230
oncoming traffic is highly
likely to stay in its lane,

253
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.465
and not try to collide with
our ego vehicle head on.

254
00:10:56.465 --> 00:10:58.700
This can help reduce
the search space

255
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.505
when trying to predict
what other agents will do.

256
00:11:01.505 --> 00:11:04.310
One of the most common
constraints imposed by

257
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.135
the rules of the road are
the lane constraints.

258
00:11:07.135 --> 00:11:08.965
The lane constraints simply put,

259
00:11:08.965 --> 00:11:11.780
are there to prevent
our motion plan from

260
00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.100
leaving the ego vehicles

261
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.830
current lane unless
it is legal to do so.

262
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.680
Lane constraints also
inform the ego vehicle

263
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.890
where it is safe to perform
turning maneuvers as well.

264
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.020
There are other soft rules of

265
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.270
the road that we need
to respect as well,

266
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.820
such as maintaining
a time gap between

267
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.790
the ego vehicle and
leading vehicles in our lane.

268
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.160
The time gap is the amount
of time that it

269
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.200
would take for
the ego vehicle to reach

270
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.135
the leading vehicles
current position

271
00:11:38.135 --> 00:11:41.150
while traveling at
the ego vehicle's current speed.

272
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.610
Maintaining a sizable
time gap helps

273
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.280
ensure safety during
motion planning,

274
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.630
by giving the ego vehicle

275
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.185
ample reaction time to
events in the workspace.

276
00:11:51.185 --> 00:11:53.630
The regulatory elements
in the workspace

277
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.060
will also impact
our driving behavior.

278
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.460
The ego vehicle clearly
needs to respect

279
00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.160
red lights and stop
signs to ensure safety,

280
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.440
but also needs to be
aware of speed limits in

281
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.740
different areas and other
dynamic regulatory elements,

282
00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.705
such as those presented
by construction sites.

283
00:12:10.705 --> 00:12:13.070
In general, regulatory elements

284
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.810
will have a large impact on

285
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.715
which behaviors are
available to us

286
00:12:16.715 --> 00:12:18.830
when performing motion planning,

287
00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.370
and will be discussed in
further detail in module five.

288
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.260
Now that we've discussed many of

289
00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.720
the autonomous driving
motion planning constraints,

290
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.555
let's summarize what
we've learned so far.

291
00:12:29.555 --> 00:12:33.365
In this video, we first
reviewed our bicycle model,

292
00:12:33.365 --> 00:12:36.635
and looked at how the models
kinematics and dynamics,

293
00:12:36.635 --> 00:12:38.375
as well as the path curvature

294
00:12:38.375 --> 00:12:40.960
constrain our motion
planning problem.

295
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.984
Next, we looked at
how static obstacles

296
00:12:43.984 --> 00:12:47.195
limit the locations
our car can safely occupy,

297
00:12:47.195 --> 00:12:50.945
which restricts our feasible
motion planning workspace,

298
00:12:50.945 --> 00:12:54.530
as well as how dynamic
obstacles impact the maneuvers

299
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.555
available to the ego vehicle
and its velocity profile.

300
00:12:58.555 --> 00:13:01.280
Finally, we discussed the role of

301
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.110
regulatory elements and how

302
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.380
they affect
our driving behaviors.

303
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.190
Hopefully, this lesson has given

304
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.600
you some insight into some of

305
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.670
the constraints of
the motion planning problem

306
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.095
for autonomous driving.

307
00:13:12.095 --> 00:13:13.460
In our next video,

308
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.010
we'll dive into some of
the optimization objectives

309
00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.030
used for solving

310
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.220
the motion planning problem.
See you there.
