00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.450
Hi everyone? So far
in this module,

2
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.095
we've described the planning
problem in general,

3
00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:21.790
we've described a hierarchy for

4
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.860
solving the complex
planning problem,

5
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.780
and we described
the constraints and

6
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.135
objectives that make
planning so hard.

7
00:00:28.135 --> 00:00:30.040
In this lesson, we'll discuss

8
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.660
the hierarchy for decomposing,

9
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.265
the overall planning problem

10
00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:36.250
into smaller sub-problems
in more detail.

11
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.290
By the end of this video,

12
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.245
you will understand the scope
of mission planning,

13
00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:44.995
behavioral planning, and
local planning sub-problems.

14
00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:46.775
You'll be able to list

15
00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:49.730
some methods for solving
each of the problems,

16
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.890
you'll also understand why

17
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.350
this hierarchy is used
in many self-driving car

18
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.020
systems progressively
refining the plans

19
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.285
for motion through
the environment.

20
00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:03.005
Let's begin by reviewing
our planning hierarchy.

21
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.810
If you recall from lesson
one of this module,

22
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.150
we introduced the
hierarchical structure we

23
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.135
will use for motion planning
and it's autonomous driving.

24
00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:14.405
We described each level of
the hierarchical planner

25
00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:17.300
as defining its own
optimization problem,

26
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.710
with each level of the hierarchy

27
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.330
having a specific degree of

28
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.220
abstraction with respect to

29
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.130
the relevant objective function
and constraints.

30
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.690
The mission planner is

31
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.480
the highest level
optimization problem where

32
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.730
we focus on map level navigation

33
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.500
from the vehicles
current position,

34
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.405
to a given destination.

35
00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:37.940
Behavioral planning on
the other hand will

36
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.220
focus on the current
driving scenario,

37
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.170
and will decide which maneuver to

38
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.165
execute based on other agents
in the workspace,

39
00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:46.755
and the rules of the road.

40
00:01:46.755 --> 00:01:49.045
Finally, we have
the local planner,

41
00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:52.145
which will focus on generating
kinematically feasible,

42
00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.590
collision-free paths, as well as

43
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.280
comfortable velocity profiles
in a decoupled manner.

44
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.380
This will then be output to

45
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.695
our vehicle controller that
we discussed in course one.

46
00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:07.100
By breaking the planning problem
into sub-problems,

47
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.190
we constrain how much knowledge
and computation is

48
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.780
required at each part of
the motion planning process.

49
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.075
Which allows for
more efficient computation.

50
00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:19.625
This comes with a
trade-off however,

51
00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:21.560
as when we decompose the problem,

52
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.990
each sub-problem loses
some domain information.

53
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.435
We end up with
a sub-optimal motion plan

54
00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:31.220
as compared to emotion plan

55
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.600
that takes all aspects of

56
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.175
the planning process into
consideration at the same time.

57
00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:37.970
For autonomous driving,

58
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.090
the ability to run
our motion planner in

59
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.070
real-time is crucial, so

60
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.650
this trade-off is
almost always worth it.

61
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.410
Some motion planning
methods integrate

62
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.315
the differing sub-problems
in varying degrees.

63
00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:52.480
But in this lesson,
we're going to focus on

64
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.790
this particular
hierarchical decomposition.

65
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.370
Next, let's go over each
of these steps in detail.

66
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.310
As mentioned, the first
and highest level step in

67
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.655
our hierarchical motion planner
is the mission planner.

68
00:03:06.655 --> 00:03:08.470
The mission planner focuses on

69
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.000
map level navigation from

70
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.040
the ego-vehicles
current position,

71
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.050
through a required destination.

72
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.405
Because the scale
of mission planning

73
00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:18.820
is often on the
order of kilometers,

74
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.630
we require a high level of

75
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.940
abstraction to make
the problem tractable.

76
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.580
In this sense we often
ignore aspects of

77
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.125
the motion planning
problems such as

78
00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:29.500
obstacles and
regulatory elements,

79
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.030
and instead focus on
the macro aspects of

80
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.465
the problem such as traffic
and road connections.

81
00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.510
By doing this, we can
simplify the problem to

82
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.050
the point where we can plan out

83
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.690
a required driving mission,

84
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.775
over a large spatial scale.

85
00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:46.760
An example is shown here
where we are planning

86
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.894
between two points on a map
of Berkeley, California,

87
00:03:49.894 --> 00:03:52.790
taking into consideration
the various intersections

88
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.770
and road connections on the map,

89
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.475
as well as the
directionality of each road.

90
00:03:57.475 --> 00:03:59.300
Doing so, we then compute

91
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.155
the shortest path in our road
network to our destination.

92
00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:05.885
This can be done in
a variety of ways.

93
00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:07.820
If we focus on the spatial length

94
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.650
of the roads in the road network,

95
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.360
we can construct a graph from

96
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.160
the road network and then use

97
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.440
Dijkstra's algorithm or A* search

98
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.255
to find the shortest path.

99
00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:19.580
If instead we focus on time to

100
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.210
destination as
our objective to minimize,

101
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.560
the problem becomes
more complex but can

102
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.200
still be solved using
the same algorithms.

103
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.940
We will discuss these methods in

104
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.405
much more detail in module three.

105
00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:33.170
The next step in

106
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.900
our hierarchical planner
is the behavior planner.

107
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.850
What is the behavior planner?

108
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.650
The behavior planner is

109
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.290
a portion of the motion
planner that focuses on

110
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.880
high level decision making

111
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.700
required to follow the
rules of the road,

112
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.620
and recognize which maneuvers are

113
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.110
safe to make in
a given driving scenario.

114
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.550
We discussed many of

115
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.400
these scenarios in
our first lessons together.

116
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.700
For example, recall that
one of the scenarios we

117
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.060
discussed was performing
a turn at an intersection.

118
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.460
Let's say for
the sake of example,

119
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.800
the ego-vehicle has
entered an intersection to

120
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.400
perform a left turn and
the light is turning green.

121
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.950
The behavior planner
should make it clear to

122
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.590
the path planner and
velocity generator,

123
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.200
that is only safe to
proceed when there is

124
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.740
sufficient time gap between
the ego-vehicles position,

125
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.300
and the oncoming traffic and

126
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.280
pedestrians in the intersection.

127
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.110
Following the taxonomy of

128
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.750
maneuvers we discussed
in our first lesson,

129
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.505
the behavior planner
should output

130
00:05:31.505 --> 00:05:32.540
a yield maneuver to

131
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.790
the remaining portion
of the motion planner,

132
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.440
which will ensure that they only

133
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.095
proceed once it is
cleared to do so.

134
00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:43.030
Of course, our taxonomy
is in no way universal,

135
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.770
there are many possibilities
when deciding what types of

136
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.540
maneuvers and what scope of

137
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.590
behaviors your autonomous car
should exhibit.

138
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.820
Now you may be wondering how is

139
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.340
the behavior planner are
supposed to take in all of

140
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.360
the information about

141
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.580
the autonomous vehicles
surroundings and

142
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.260
calculate what maneuver it should

143
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.735
execute in an efficient manner.

144
00:06:02.735 --> 00:06:05.990
This is an area of active
research and there

145
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.855
is no settled best method
to achieve this.

146
00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:10.370
In general, there appear to be

147
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.040
three different
prevailing architectures

148
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.055
to solve the behavioral
planning problem.

149
00:06:16.055 --> 00:06:18.710
The first group are methods that

150
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.765
use finite state machines.

151
00:06:20.765 --> 00:06:22.340
The key concept behind

152
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.085
finite state machines is
that they are composed

153
00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:27.980
of: states which represent

154
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.520
the ego-vehicles
required maneuvers,

155
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.930
and transitions which dictate how

156
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.915
the state should evolve
depending on the inputs.

157
00:06:35.915 --> 00:06:38.795
These may be things
like: vehicle locations,

158
00:06:38.795 --> 00:06:40.700
traffic light transitions, or

159
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.750
any other element of

160
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.260
interest in our current
driving scenario.

161
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.370
As an example, one could imagine

162
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.230
a state machine that handles stop

163
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.130
signs to have a state such
as decelerate to stop,

164
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.530
stop and track speed.

165
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.780
When a car encounters
a stop sign,

166
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.110
it would first enter
the decelerate to stop state,

167
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.550
where the behavioral
planner would then

168
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.905
signal that it is
time to decelerate.

169
00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:06.830
Once it has stopped
at the stop location,

170
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.750
the behavior planner
will remain in

171
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.050
the stop state for
a set amount of time.

172
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.270
Once the time has been exceeded

173
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.890
and the intersection is clear,

174
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.500
the behavior planner will
then enter the track speeds

175
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.725
state which means it is
safe to continue driving.

176
00:07:21.725 --> 00:07:23.420
We go through this example in

177
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.330
more detail in a later module
in this course.

178
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.620
It is important to note that

179
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.090
when deciding which transition

180
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.005
to take at each step of
the finite state machine,

181
00:07:32.005 --> 00:07:35.240
we focus entirely on
the current state,

182
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.595
and the inputs to
the finite state machine.

183
00:07:37.595 --> 00:07:39.350
Essentially, this means that

184
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.990
the finite state
machine is memoryless.

185
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.150
Its past states do not

186
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.150
impact the current
transition or output.

187
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.700
This is a helpful
property that makes

188
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.535
finite state machines
straightforward to implement,

189
00:07:52.535 --> 00:07:55.190
but can lead to many states
that are similar

190
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.610
for systems where sequences
of actions do matter.

191
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.620
The next common type of

192
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.425
behavioral planners are
rule-based systems.

193
00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:05.690
Essentially,
these type of systems

194
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.030
consist of a hierarchy of rules,

195
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.650
where the hierarchy represents

196
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.245
the relative importance
of each rule.

197
00:08:12.245 --> 00:08:14.660
Each rule may
correspond to a rule of

198
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.300
the road such as
stopping at a red light,

199
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.410
or may correspond to

200
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.390
a driving best practice such as

201
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.520
maintaining a two second gap,

202
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.510
between the ego-vehicle
and a leading vehicle.

203
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.920
The state of the ego-vehicle and

204
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.855
its surroundings
would then be fed

205
00:08:29.855 --> 00:08:31.750
into the rule-based system in

206
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.295
the form of logical predicates.

207
00:08:34.295 --> 00:08:37.010
These predicates would
then be evaluated against

208
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.100
every rule and based
on the rule priority,

209
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.840
the maneuver corresponding to

210
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.760
the highest priority rule would

211
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.790
be output to the rest
of the motion planner.

212
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.275
For example, suppose we have
the following two rules.

213
00:08:51.275 --> 00:08:54.650
The first rule checks if
there is a green light ahead

214
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.950
and issues a decision for
the car to continue driving.

215
00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.160
While the second rule checks
if there are pedestrians in

216
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.275
the cars lanes and issues

217
00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:06.755
a decision to perform
the emergency stop maneuver.

218
00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:10.100
In our system, stopping
for a pedestrian in

219
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.020
front of us is higher priority

220
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.150
than driving through green light.

221
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.950
Now suppose we were driving

222
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.810
along and observe
a green light at

223
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.850
the upcoming
intersection as well as

224
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.680
a pedestrian crossing illegally

225
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.345
in front of the intersection.

226
00:09:23.345 --> 00:09:25.970
Both rules would trigger
in this case but

227
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.414
since the emergency stop
is higher priority,

228
00:09:28.414 --> 00:09:29.690
that is the maneuver that

229
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.655
the rule-based system
will output.

230
00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:33.680
As you can imagine, it is both

231
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.570
important and challenging to

232
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.320
make sure rule-based systems
are logically consistent.

233
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.920
Otherwise, they can
exhibit erratic behavior.

234
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.930
The final group of

235
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.580
behavior planning approaches are

236
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.620
machine learning-based methods.

237
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.990
In particular,
an interesting example of

238
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.810
this method is using
reinforcement learning.

239
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.750
Reinforcement learning is
the process of determining

240
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.165
an optimal decision-making policy

241
00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:02.240
that maximizes
some reward function R.

242
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.130
This reward function values

243
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.650
the quality of a given chain
of actions for

244
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.840
all time steps discounting

245
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.555
future states more
heavily than the present.

246
00:10:11.555 --> 00:10:13.850
The process of
reinforcement learning

247
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.440
requires the agent to

248
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.570
perform actions in an environment

249
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.865
often given by simulation.

250
00:10:19.865 --> 00:10:21.845
This agent is then rewarded

251
00:10:21.845 --> 00:10:24.410
according to its interaction
with the environment.

252
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.510
Which then allows
it to converge to

253
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.215
an optimal policy through
successive interactions.

254
00:10:30.215 --> 00:10:33.650
This group of behavior planning
approaches is rapidly

255
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.695
expanding area of research
and unfortunately,

256
00:10:36.695 --> 00:10:40.265
a deep dive is beyond
the scope of this course.

257
00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:42.890
The next and final module in

258
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.875
our hierarchical planner
is the local planner.

259
00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:48.020
As mentioned earlier, the goal

260
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.895
of the local planner
is to generate

261
00:10:49.895 --> 00:10:53.285
kinematically feasible
and collision-free paths

262
00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:54.605
as well as comfortable,

263
00:10:54.605 --> 00:10:57.635
and safe velocity profiles
for the ego vehicle.

264
00:10:57.635 --> 00:11:00.095
We decompose the local
planning problem

265
00:11:00.095 --> 00:11:01.520
into two sub-problems;

266
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.150
path planning and velocity
profile generation.

267
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.745
The key ingenuity
behind developing

268
00:11:07.745 --> 00:11:09.890
a good path planning algorithm is

269
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.665
reducing the search
space for optimization.

270
00:11:12.665 --> 00:11:16.040
There are three main categories
of path planners;

271
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.795
sampling-based planners,

272
00:11:17.795 --> 00:11:21.185
variational planners
and lattice planners.

273
00:11:21.185 --> 00:11:24.200
Sampling-based planners
randomly sample

274
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.945
the control inputs of
the car uniformly,

275
00:11:26.945 --> 00:11:28.190
in order to generate

276
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.995
potential paths for
the car to traverse.

277
00:11:30.995 --> 00:11:34.220
One of the most iconic
sampling-based algorithms is

278
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.680
the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree

279
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.065
or RRT and its variance.

280
00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:42.500
These algorithms
construct the branches

281
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.940
of the tree of paths by

282
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.060
generating points in
randomly sampled locations

283
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.025
and planning a path to the point,

284
00:11:49.025 --> 00:11:52.020
from the nearest point
in the tree.

285
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.860
If the path is free from

286
00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.185
collisions with
any static obstacles,

287
00:11:57.185 --> 00:11:59.510
that path is added to the tree.

288
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.600
This tree quickly explores
the workspace with

289
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.290
many potential paths and when
a goal region is reached,

290
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.605
the path that terminates in
that region is returned.

291
00:12:09.605 --> 00:12:11.915
Sampling-based
algorithms are often

292
00:12:11.915 --> 00:12:14.090
extremely fast but at the cost of

293
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.060
potentially generating
poorer quality erratic paths

294
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.760
when run in a short
number of cycles.

295
00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.940
Variational planners
rely on the calculus of

296
00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.510
variations to optimize
a trajectory function which

297
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.100
maps points in time to

298
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.830
positions in the workspace
according to some

299
00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.515
cost-functional that
takes obstacles

300
00:12:33.515 --> 00:12:36.185
and robot dynamics
into consideration.

301
00:12:36.185 --> 00:12:39.920
Variational planners are
usually trajectory planners,

302
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.515
which means they combine
both path planning

303
00:12:42.515 --> 00:12:45.620
and velocity planning
into a single-step.

304
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.930
So they do not have
to decouple the path

305
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.080
planning and velocity
planning problems.

306
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.080
As an example, suppose
we start off with

307
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.530
a given discrete sampling
of a path in space.

308
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.030
At first, it is in

309
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.580
collision with an obstacle
shown as well.

310
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.580
A variational planner
will iteratively move

311
00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.650
the discrete points
such that they are

312
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.845
smooth with respect to
the robot's dynamics,

313
00:13:09.845 --> 00:13:12.620
as well as keeping
them collision-free.

314
00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.020
By the end, the
trajectory will be both

315
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.330
collision-free and smoother with

316
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.610
respect to the dynamics
of the robot.

317
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:22.985
However, variational methods
are often slower,

318
00:13:22.985 --> 00:13:25.700
more complex and
their convergence to

319
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.075
a feasible path is sensitive
to the initial conditions.

320
00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:31.415
An example of
a variational method

321
00:13:31.415 --> 00:13:33.080
is the chomp algorithm.

322
00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.170
Variational planners go beyond
the scope of this course,

323
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:37.670
but for those interested,

324
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.610
the chomp algorithm provides
an excellent example for

325
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.845
further exploration
and is included

326
00:13:42.845 --> 00:13:45.860
in a link in the
supplemental materials.

327
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.880
The final group of path
planners are lattice planners.

328
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.630
Lattice planners constrain
the search space by limiting

329
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.460
the actions that
the ego vehicle can

330
00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.100
take at any point
in the workspace.

331
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.170
This set of actions is known as

332
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.645
the control set of
the lattice planner.

333
00:14:02.645 --> 00:14:04.760
This control set, when paired

334
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.920
with a discretization
of the workspace,

335
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.570
implicitly defines a graph.

336
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.400
This graph can then
be searched using

337
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.880
a graph search algorithm
such as Dijkstra's or A*,

338
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.110
which results in
fast computation of paths.

339
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:23.045
Obstacles can set edges that
cross them to infinite cost.

340
00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:24.890
So the graph search allows us to

341
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.245
perform collision
checking as well.

342
00:14:27.245 --> 00:14:30.455
While the lattice planner
is often quite fast,

343
00:14:30.455 --> 00:14:31.940
the quality of paths are

344
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.045
sensitive to the
selected control set.

345
00:14:35.045 --> 00:14:37.820
A common variance on
the lattice planner is

346
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.010
known as the conformal
lattice planner.

347
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.480
Where a goal points are

348
00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.255
selected some distance
ahead of the car,

349
00:14:44.255 --> 00:14:45.800
laterally offset from one

350
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.780
another with respect
to the direction of

351
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:52.295
the road and a path is optimized
to each of these points.

352
00:14:52.295 --> 00:14:56.030
The path that best satisfies
some objective while also

353
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.950
remaining collision free is

354
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.710
then chosen as the
path to execute.

355
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.465
In our previous video,

356
00:15:02.465 --> 00:15:05.150
we outlined some objectives
that we can choose

357
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.105
to influence the path
planning process such as,

358
00:15:08.105 --> 00:15:10.415
arc length and bending energy.

359
00:15:10.415 --> 00:15:11.990
The second part of

360
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.425
our local Plan is
the velocity profile generation.

361
00:15:15.425 --> 00:15:18.050
Velocity profile
generation is usually

362
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.050
set up as a constrained
optimization problem.

363
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.600
Generally, we would
combine many of

364
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.310
the velocity profile objectives

365
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.710
described in
the previous video such

366
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.260
as the goals of minimizing

367
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.865
jerk or minimizing deviation
from a desired reference.

368
00:15:34.865 --> 00:15:36.965
We also discussed

369
00:15:36.965 --> 00:15:39.350
some important constraints
in lesson two.

370
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.285
One of which was the rectangle

371
00:15:41.285 --> 00:15:43.340
of comfortable accelerations.

372
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.650
This is in no way
an exhaustive list

373
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.300
of objectives or constraints.

374
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.995
You will encounter many more

375
00:15:48.995 --> 00:15:51.290
in your time as
an autonomy engineer.

376
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.590
Once the objectives and
constraints are formalized,

377
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.830
it becomes a matter of solving
the problem efficiently.

378
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.230
One way to do this
is to calculate

379
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.000
convex approximations to

380
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.114
the optimization domain
and objectives,

381
00:16:04.114 --> 00:16:05.450
which helps ensure that

382
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.630
our optimizer doesn't get
stuck in local minima.

383
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.210
Now that we've
discussed each level

384
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.665
in our hierarchical planner,

385
00:16:12.665 --> 00:16:15.605
let's summarize what we've
covered in this lesson.

386
00:16:15.605 --> 00:16:19.340
We first went over mission
planning and how our planner

387
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.075
navigates through a map to
get to our destination.

388
00:16:23.075 --> 00:16:26.045
Next, we discussed
behavior planning.

389
00:16:26.045 --> 00:16:28.190
Where we need to select driving

390
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.340
behaviors based on
the situation at hand.

391
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.640
Finally, we discussed
the local planner,

392
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.260
which we split into path

393
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.140
planning and velocity
profile generation.

394
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.600
We gave a few examples
of the types of

395
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.940
path planning algorithms and we

396
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.380
discussed how to optimize

397
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.940
the velocity profile for

398
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.535
a given plan path
and reference speed.

399
00:16:49.535 --> 00:16:51.275
Congratulations,

400
00:16:51.275 --> 00:16:53.270
you've reached the end
of the first module in

401
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.810
the fourth course of our
self-driving car specialization.

402
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.600
Hopefully, you now have
a good idea of what

403
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.310
the different approaches are when

404
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.010
designing a hierarchical
motion planner.

405
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.095
Throughout the rest
of this course,

406
00:17:06.095 --> 00:17:08.150
we'll introduce
the tools you need to

407
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.790
solve each level of
the motion planning problem.

408
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.200
But before we do that,

409
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.400
we're going to look at how to

410
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.350
build occupancy grid maps for

411
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.540
effective collision
avoidance detection

412
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.670
in the next module.
See you there.
