00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.700
Welcome to the third and
final lesson this week.

2
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.130
In this video, we will be
looking at the concept of

3
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.130
time to collision between
two dynamic objects.

4
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.155
In this video we will

5
00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:27.690
present two alternatives
for calculating

6
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.449
the time to collision:
simulation-based approaches

7
00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.400
and estimation-based approaches.

8
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.890
Compare the strengths
and weaknesses of

9
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.660
both approaches and highlight

10
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.075
where each is most readily used,

11
00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:42.650
and explore the simulation-based
approach in more detail

12
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.790
and calculate the time

13
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.355
to collision between
any two vehicles.

14
00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:50.600
Let's dive in. The time
to collision provides

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.860
a valuable measure of

16
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.865
behavioral safety in
a self-driving vehicle,

17
00:00:54.865 --> 00:00:58.340
and is heavily used in
assessing potential maneuvers,

18
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.890
based on the current
driving environment.

19
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.920
By knowing if collisions
are imminent and

20
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.770
when they might occur
and with which object,

21
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.510
a self-driving system can better

22
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.960
plan safe maneuvers
through the environment,

23
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.080
or prepare for emergency
evasive actions if needed.

24
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.910
To evaluate the time

25
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.280
to collision between
dynamic objects,

26
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.260
we use their predicted paths to

27
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.795
identify possible
collision points.

28
00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:25.790
If a collision point exists,

29
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.830
the time to collision
is a measure of

30
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.545
the amount of time until
that collision occurs.

31
00:01:30.545 --> 00:01:32.960
Computing the time
to collision can therefore

32
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.300
be accomplished in two steps.

33
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.720
First, we identify and
compute the location of

34
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.130
a collision point along

35
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.085
the predicted paths between
the dynamic objects,

36
00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:46.610
and second, if such
a collision point exists,

37
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.280
we then compute the amount of
time that it will take for

38
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.185
the dynamic objects to arrive
at that collision point.

39
00:01:53.185 --> 00:01:56.300
The challenge with computing
the time to collision,

40
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.950
is that it relies very much

41
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.810
on an accurate understanding of

42
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.504
the space that will be occupied

43
00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:03.530
by the objects in the future,

44
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.070
to achieve accurate estimates.

45
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.660
Clearly, accurate predictions of

46
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.100
the objects trajectories are

47
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.395
critical to identifying
collision points

48
00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:14.000
in their time of occurrence.

49
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.300
Precise prediction of
object trajectories is as we

50
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.860
saw in the previous two lessons,
a difficult problem.

51
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.850
Furthermore, we also need

52
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.380
accurate geometries for

53
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.810
all dynamic objects
in the environment.

54
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.460
This is required as when

55
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.410
the time to collision
is computed,

56
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.270
the geometries of
both the vehicles are

57
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.965
considered to calculate
the exact collision point.

58
00:02:35.965 --> 00:02:39.020
As objects in the
environment are only seen

59
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.450
from the current
and previous viewpoints,

60
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.160
it can be challenging
to accurately

61
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.635
define their geometry
while driving.

62
00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:48.224
Due to errors in
both requirements,

63
00:02:48.224 --> 00:02:49.580
the time to collision should

64
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.800
always be treated as
an approximation,

65
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.230
updated regularly,
and treated with

66
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.160
some safety buffer when making
decisions about driving.

67
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.890
There are two main
approaches to calculating

68
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.500
the time to collision
between two objects.

69
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.570
The simulation-based approach,

70
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.820
and the estimation-based
approach.

71
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.345
Simulation-based approaches
simulate the movement of

72
00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:13.160
every vehicle in this scene over

73
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.470
a finite horizon into the future.

74
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.520
At each simulation time
step, new position, heading,

75
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.575
and occupancy extent predictions

76
00:03:21.575 --> 00:03:24.770
are calculated for
every dynamic object.

77
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.870
This is done by propagating

78
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.985
forward the predicted trajectory,

79
00:03:28.985 --> 00:03:31.720
as discussed in
the previous module.

80
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.060
Once the position of
all dynamic objects is

81
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.940
known for a given time
in the simulated future,

82
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.295
a check is conducted
to determine if

83
00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:42.620
any two or more dynamic objects

84
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.270
have collided with each other.

85
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.415
If they have collided,
the location

86
00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:48.740
and time to the collision
is then noted.

87
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.750
Note that this is
a different type of

88
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.180
collision checking than
in the static case,

89
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.400
where swaths of
the entire path were

90
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.240
constructed and compared to
static object locations.

91
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.250
Because these
collision checks are

92
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.514
performed between moving objects,

93
00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:05.600
we only need to check
collisions between

94
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.615
the geometries of
each object at each instant,

95
00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.310
as the objects will occupy

96
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.255
new locations at
the next time step.

97
00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:16.070
Estimation-based
approaches function

98
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.885
by computing the evolution

99
00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:19.865
of the geometry of each vehicle

100
00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:22.025
as it moves through
its predicted path.

101
00:04:22.025 --> 00:04:24.635
The results is a swath
for each vehicle

102
00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:27.755
that can then be compared
for potential collisions.

103
00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:29.990
Once the swath has been computed,

104
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.910
their intersection
can be explored for

105
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.235
potential collision points
by computing,

106
00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:36.440
if any two or more
dynamic objects

107
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.305
will occupy the same space
at the same time.

108
00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:42.775
If this is true, potential
collision points are tagged,

109
00:04:42.775 --> 00:04:45.890
and an estimation of when
each vehicle will arrive

110
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.210
at each collision point is

111
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.700
used to estimate
the time to collision.

112
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.980
This method traditionally makes

113
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.600
many simplifying assumptions

114
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.835
to accelerate the calculations.

115
00:04:55.835 --> 00:04:58.370
These assumptions
include: identifying

116
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.305
collision point locations based

117
00:05:00.305 --> 00:05:02.975
on object path
intersection points,

118
00:05:02.975 --> 00:05:06.080
estimating object space
occupancy based on

119
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.350
simple geometric primitives
like bounding boxes,

120
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.300
and estimating the time to reach

121
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.005
a collision point based on
a constant velocity profile.

122
00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:17.120
Each approach has strengths and

123
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.980
weaknesses relative to the other.

124
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.350
Estimation-based
approaches rely on

125
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.230
simplifying assumptions which
make the computation of

126
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.229
time to collision less
computationally expensive

127
00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.450
both in terms of
memory requirements,

128
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.280
and processing efforts.

129
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.230
Simulation approaches tend to

130
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.970
be more computationally
expensive,

131
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.790
as they involve
step-by-step evaluations,

132
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.185
and object geometry
intersection computations.

133
00:05:41.185 --> 00:05:44.280
Due to their simplifying
assumptions however,

134
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.120
estimation-based approaches
usually create

135
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.710
a less accurate estimate of

136
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.560
the collision point and
the time to collision.

137
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.930
Simulation approaches
on the other hand do

138
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.395
not need to rely on
these approximations,

139
00:05:56.395 --> 00:05:58.305
and with small step sizes,

140
00:05:58.305 --> 00:06:00.545
can perform high
fidelity evaluation

141
00:06:00.545 --> 00:06:02.075
of the time to collision.

142
00:06:02.075 --> 00:06:04.265
These relative differences make

143
00:06:04.265 --> 00:06:07.295
each algorithm suited to
different applications.

144
00:06:07.295 --> 00:06:09.485
For real-time
applications such as

145
00:06:09.485 --> 00:06:11.900
onboard time to
collision computation,

146
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.540
estimation-based approaches
are preferred.

147
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.900
Whereas offline, where
accuracy is vital

148
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.590
such as dataset creation and
simulation-based testing,

149
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.440
simulation-based approaches
are preferred.

150
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.560
Let's look at a simple
simulation-based approach

151
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.720
to calculating
both the collision points,

152
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.840
and the time to each collision
point in more detail.

153
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.210
Estimation-based
approaches are outside

154
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.560
the scope of this video,

155
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.360
but we've included
an extensive set of links to

156
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.830
estimation-based methods in
the supplemental materials.

157
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.800
The algorithm for
the simulation-based approach

158
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.400
takes as input a list
of dynamic objects D,

159
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.840
with their predicted paths

160
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.935
including the planned path
for the ego vehicle.

161
00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:58.520
The time between simulation
prediction steps DT if sim,

162
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.530
and any parameters
needed to define

163
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.750
the collision checking
approach to be used.

164
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.505
Be it polygon intersection

165
00:07:04.505 --> 00:07:06.470
requiring the object footprints,

166
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.350
or circle checking requiring
the number of circles,

167
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.545
and their spacing relative
to the object position.

168
00:07:12.545 --> 00:07:14.510
The output that
this algorithm will

169
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.325
provide is the collision point

170
00:07:16.325 --> 00:07:17.630
and the time to collision for

171
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.940
every pair of objects
that have one.

172
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.640
Note that the simulation
time steps can be

173
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.640
a different size than
the predicted path time steps,

174
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.985
to improve collision checking
approximation accuracy.

175
00:07:28.985 --> 00:07:32.000
The algorithm loops through
each time step from

176
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.060
the current time to the end
of the simulation horizon,

177
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.250
which can't exceed
the maximum length

178
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.500
of the predicted
and planned paths.

179
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.060
At each time step,

180
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.130
we propagate forward
the positions

181
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.020
of all dynamic objects along

182
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.880
their path by one step using

183
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.360
the dynamic object
motion predictions.

184
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.080
The object states,
position, heading,

185
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.095
and velocity of all objects

186
00:07:54.095 --> 00:07:55.910
are established
through this update,

187
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.920
one time step at a time.

188
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.230
Then for every pair of objects,

189
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.720
we perform pairwise
collision checking.

190
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.940
If a collision point is found,

191
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.370
then the current
simulated time is added to

192
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.135
this collision point to
estimate the time to collision.

193
00:08:11.135 --> 00:08:13.250
Let's refine each stage of

194
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.560
the simulation approach
a little further.

195
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.380
For state prediction, we
must take into account

196
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.645
the possibility that the
predicted path state time steps,

197
00:08:21.645 --> 00:08:24.395
do not align with
the simulation time steps.

198
00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:26.540
Thus to get the best estimate of

199
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.820
a given dynamic object
vehicle state at

200
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.550
a point in time required
by the simulation,

201
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.410
we find the closest state

202
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:35.840
preceding the current
simulated time,

203
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.020
either by looping through
each object's predicted path,

204
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.670
or by tracking
the current predicted

205
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.450
path reference states
throughout the simulation loop.

206
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.270
We then apply
the predicted inputs for

207
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.950
the remaining interval of time to

208
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.590
arrive at a prediction
of the object location,

209
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.785
at the current simulation time.

210
00:08:53.785 --> 00:08:56.005
For pairwise collision checking,

211
00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:59.675
we can proceed either
exactly or approximately.

212
00:08:59.675 --> 00:09:02.300
In either case, because
we're now comparing

213
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.800
pairs of dynamic objects
with each other,

214
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.240
we present both objects
similarly and must modify

215
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.890
our collision check to not

216
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.290
rely on occupancy
grid information,

217
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.750
as we did in the static case.

218
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.970
For the exact approach,

219
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.295
a polygonal intersection
is performed

220
00:09:19.295 --> 00:09:22.015
and any overlap
implies a collision.

221
00:09:22.015 --> 00:09:23.850
For the circle approximation,

222
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.900
each circle pair is compared,

223
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.325
which leads to
nine distance checks for

224
00:09:28.325 --> 00:09:30.410
three circle approximation and

225
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.785
16 distance checks for
a four-circle approximation.

226
00:09:33.785 --> 00:09:35.420
Note that as the number of

227
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.640
dynamic objects increases
in the scene,

228
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.640
the number of collision checks
scales quadratically,

229
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.975
if exhaustively evaluating
all possible collisions.

230
00:09:44.975 --> 00:09:47.810
It is of course also
possible to only

231
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.300
compare the ego
vehicle to others,

232
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.695
to keep computational
complexity linear,

233
00:09:52.695 --> 00:09:56.630
or eliminate large portions
of the pairwise comparisons,

234
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.330
based on a single
point-to-point distance check

235
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.995
between the centroids.

236
00:10:00.995 --> 00:10:03.530
If two objects are not
within a distance of

237
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.620
two times their combined
longest axis dimension,

238
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.675
no further checking is required.

239
00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:10.730
Once a collision is detected,

240
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.440
a calculation can be performed

241
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.435
to establish the collision point.

242
00:10:14.435 --> 00:10:17.240
If we assume small increments
for the simulation,

243
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.730
this first collision point
is a single point that

244
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.830
satisfies both equations of

245
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.155
the circles around each object.

246
00:10:24.155 --> 00:10:26.870
Rearranging leads to
the following pair of

247
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.510
equations for x
and y coordinates.

248
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.180
The x-coordinate of
the collision point is equal

249
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.120
to the x-coordinate of
the center of circle I,

250
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.885
multiplied by
the radius of circle j,

251
00:10:37.885 --> 00:10:39.830
plus the x-coordinate of circle j

252
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.810
multiplied by
the radius of circle I.

253
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.900
All divided by the sum
of the two radii.

254
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.500
The same equation is then
used for the y-coordinate;

255
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.270
however, using
the y-coordinate of

256
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.825
both circles rather
than the x-coordinate.

257
00:10:52.825 --> 00:10:55.340
It is also possible to identify

258
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.220
both intersection points
when the circles overlap,

259
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.080
and the equations are available

260
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.620
in the supplementary materials.

261
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.555
As is often the case,

262
00:11:04.555 --> 00:11:06.260
there exists a trade-off between

263
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.620
the accuracy of the time
to collision estimate,

264
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.870
and the overall computation time.

265
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.915
As we increase the fidelity
of the collision check,

266
00:11:14.915 --> 00:11:18.290
we also increase the number
of computations required.

267
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.500
Likewise as can be
seen in this example,

268
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.590
if we reduce the number of
circles considered to one,

269
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.050
the number of
computations goes down,

270
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.340
but the accuracy of

271
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.980
the exact collision points
suffers significantly.

272
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.640
You should now have
a strong handle

273
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.590
on the time to collision
computation,

274
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.870
and the implications
of approximations in

275
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.750
terms of accuracy of
the predicted solution.

276
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.180
To summarize in this video,

277
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.860
we defined the time to collision

278
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.080
for pairs of dynamic objects.

279
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.660
We discussed the strengths
and weaknesses of

280
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.450
two types of time
to collision algorithms,

281
00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.755
simulation-based and
estimation based.

282
00:11:56.755 --> 00:11:59.510
We presented the
simulation-based approach to

283
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.975
time to collision prediction,
in more detail.

284
00:12:02.975 --> 00:12:04.955
Congratulations.

285
00:12:04.955 --> 00:12:05.720
You've made it through

286
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.360
the dynamic object
interactions module.

287
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.400
In this module,
you learned how to

288
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.470
predict a dynamic objects motion,

289
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.035
using the constant
velocity model,

290
00:12:15.035 --> 00:12:17.390
you refined your
motion predictions to

291
00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.300
incorporate HD road
map information,

292
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.465
and you apply your motion
predictions to the task

293
00:12:23.465 --> 00:12:24.860
of estimating the time

294
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.140
to collision between
dynamic objects.

295
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.895
We'll see you in the next module,

296
00:12:28.895 --> 00:12:30.910
where we will study
the behavior planner,

297
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.540
the key decision-maker for

298
00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.150
selecting appropriate
maneuvers to execute,

299
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:39.420
for every driving scenario
encountered. See you there.
