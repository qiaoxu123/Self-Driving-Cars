00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.870
In the last video, we

2
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.835
introduced the Extended
Kalman Filter,

3
00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:20.115
which uses
local linearization

4
00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:21.540
as a way to allow us to

5
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.640
apply the Kalman
filter equations

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.395
to non-linear systems.

7
00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:26.820
In this video, we're

8
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.960
going to look
at a variant of

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.355
the EKF called the

10
00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:31.290
Error-State Extended
Kalman Filter,

11
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.280
or ES-EKF, which
has a couple of

12
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.630
nice properties that will

13
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.370
come in handy later
in the course.

14
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.615
By the end of this video,

15
00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:40.350
you'll be able to describe

16
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.700
the error state
formulation

17
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.890
of the Extended
Kalman Filter,

18
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.470
and describe the
advantages of

19
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.540
the error state EKF
over the vanilla

20
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.070
EKF that you learned

21
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.980
about in the
previous video.

22
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.740
The idea behind
the error state EKF

23
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.145
is really very simple.

24
00:00:55.145 --> 00:00:56.240
We're going to
start thinking

25
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.210
about our vehicle state,

26
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.600
x, as being composed
of two parts;

27
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.830
a large part called

28
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.900
the nominal state, x hat,

29
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.490
and a small part called

30
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.055
the error state, Delta x.

31
00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:08.990
We can think of
a simple example of

32
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.345
tracking the position
of a car over time.

33
00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:12.650
The green line shows

34
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.830
the true position
of the car,

35
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.915
which is the quantity

36
00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:16.565
we're trying to estimate.

37
00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:19.640
The red line is
the nominal state,

38
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.110
or our best guess what

39
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.270
the true state could
be based on what

40
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.010
we know about the
car's motion model and

41
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.410
acceleration and
breaking inputs.

42
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.435
Of course,
our motion model

43
00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:30.665
is never perfect,

44
00:01:30.665 --> 00:01:31.610
and there is always

45
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.340
some random process noise.

46
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.920
These errors build up over

47
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.035
time as we integrate
the motion model.

48
00:01:37.035 --> 00:01:38.840
We can think of
the error state

49
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.950
as the place where all of

50
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.210
these modelling errors and

51
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.110
process noise
accumulate over time,

52
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.530
so that the error state

53
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.700
is just the
difference between

54
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.170
the nominal state and

55
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.390
the true state at
any given time.

56
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.650
If we can figure out what

57
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.970
the error state is,

58
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.980
we can actually use
it as a correction to

59
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.420
the nominal state to bring

60
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.705
us closer to
the true state.

61
00:01:58.705 --> 00:02:01.270
So, in the error
state EKF,

62
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.200
instead of doing
Kalman filtering on

63
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.060
the full state
which might have

64
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.720
lots of complicated
non-linear behaviors,

65
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.380
we're going to
use the EKF to

66
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.645
estimate the error
state instead,

67
00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:13.250
and then use
the estimate of

68
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.420
the error state as

69
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.400
a correction to
the nominal state.

70
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.320
What this means
mathematically

71
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.040
is that we're going to

72
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.810
rearrange our
linearized motion

73
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.310
model so that we now

74
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.900
have an equation
that can tell us how

75
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.770
the difference between

76
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.850
the true state at time,

77
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.910
k, and our predicted
state at time, k,

78
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.040
is related to
the same difference

79
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.870
at time, k minus one.

80
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.730
These differences
are exactly

81
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.265
the error states we
just talked about;

82
00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:41.225
Delta x sub k and
Delta x sub k minus one,

83
00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:43.340
and the equations
relating them are

84
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.845
called the error
state kinematics.

85
00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:47.494
We can also re-express

86
00:02:47.494 --> 00:02:49.220
our linearized
measurement model in

87
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.380
terms of the error
state directly.

88
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.900
We can use this error
state formulation of

89
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.195
the EKF in
a very similar way

90
00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:57.800
to the vanilla EKF.

91
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.330
We start off by updating

92
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.890
the nominal state using

93
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.480
the non-linear
motion model

94
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.760
and our current best
estimate of the state.

95
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.840
We could do this a bunch

96
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.860
of times before ever

97
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.805
getting a measurement

98
00:03:07.805 --> 00:03:08.840
for the correction step.

99
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.700
So, the current
best estimate

100
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.625
might be x check or x hat.

101
00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:15.170
We also need to keep track

102
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.640
of the state covariance,

103
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.200
which grows as
we integrate

104
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.895
more and more
process noise

105
00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:21.275
from the motion model.

106
00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:22.610
Note that again,

107
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.230
the previous
covariance estimate

108
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.495
could be P check

109
00:03:25.495 --> 00:03:27.590
or P hat depending
on whether we

110
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.690
used a measurement to
do a correction step.

111
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.115
We can repeat the loop

112
00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:32.510
updating the
nominal state and

113
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.710
the error state covariance

114
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:34.790
for as long as we like

115
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.275
until we receive
the measurement

116
00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:38.215
and want to do
a correction.

117
00:03:38.215 --> 00:03:40.010
When this happens,
we can compute

118
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.915
the Kalman gain as usual,

119
00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:44.030
and then compute
the best estimate of

120
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.415
the error state using
the Kalman gain,

121
00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:47.720
the measurement, and

122
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.520
our nonlinear
measurement model.

123
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.120
Now,

124
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.370
here's where things
are little different.

125
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.840
Once we have
an estimate for

126
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.320
the mean of
the error state,

127
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.380
we want to use
this to update

128
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.095
the nominal state and
correct the error.

129
00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:01.775
We can do that by just

130
00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:03.530
adding our estimate
of the error state to

131
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.030
the nominal state to get

132
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.200
the correct state estimate

133
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.555
for the full state.

134
00:04:07.555 --> 00:04:09.470
Finally, we can update

135
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.820
the state covariance using

136
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.390
the usual equations.
That's it.

137
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.200
This process
goes on forever,

138
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.870
or at least until

139
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.455
the vehicle runs
out of gas.

140
00:04:18.455 --> 00:04:20.800
So, why would we
actually want to use

141
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.215
the error state EKF
in practice?

142
00:04:23.215 --> 00:04:25.540
Well, there are two
good reasons to use it.

143
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.700
One reason is that
it can often work

144
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.530
better than the
vanilla EKF because

145
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.660
the small error
state is more

146
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.710
amenable to
linear filtering

147
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.525
than the large
nominal state,

148
00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.410
which we can integrate
non-linearly.

149
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.150
The other reason is that

150
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.085
the error state
formulation makes it much

151
00:04:42.085 --> 00:04:44.425
easier to work with
constrained quantities

152
00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:47.020
like rotations, which
will come in handy a

153
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.700
bit later in the course.

154
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.440
The reason for
this is that we

155
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.970
don't necessarily
have to use

156
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.980
plane vector addition to

157
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.430
break down the state.

158
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.260
In fact, we could use

159
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.320
any generalized
composition operation

160
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.770
we like as long as it

161
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.870
gives us a consistent way
of incorporating

162
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.755
small perturbations
into the nominal state.

163
00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:08.840
If this all sounds
a bit abstract

164
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.285
right now, don't worry.

165
00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:11.820
Later in the
course, we'll use

166
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.760
the error state
EKF to help

167
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.175
us deal with rotations
in 3D space,

168
00:05:16.175 --> 00:05:17.915
which are
a very common type

169
00:05:17.915 --> 00:05:19.475
of constraint quantity.

170
00:05:19.475 --> 00:05:22.880
Let's recap. The error
state formulation

171
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.140
of the EKF separates

172
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.550
the vehicle state into

173
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.215
a large nominal state

174
00:05:27.215 --> 00:05:29.240
and a small error state.

175
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.370
The nominal state
keeps track of what

176
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.615
the motion model predicts

177
00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:33.895
the states should be,

178
00:05:33.895 --> 00:05:35.060
while the error state

179
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.620
captures the
modelling errors and

180
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.560
process noise that
accumulate over time.

181
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.075
In the error state EKF,

182
00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:43.055
we estimate
this small error state

183
00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:43.760
and use it as

184
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.620
a correction to
the nominal state.

185
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.360
This is the main
difference between

186
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.225
the error state EKF
and the vanilla EKF,

187
00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.235
which estimates
the full state.

188
00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:54.410
Keep in mind that
both formulations

189
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.385
still rely on
local linearization.

190
00:05:57.385 --> 00:05:59.480
The error state
EKF has a couple

191
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.550
of advantages over
the vanilla EKF.

192
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.320
The first is that
it simply performs

193
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.610
better because
the evolution

194
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.170
of the error state tends

195
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.895
to be closer to linear.

196
00:06:07.895 --> 00:06:09.050
The other is that

197
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.190
the error state
formulation

198
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.330
makes it easier to handle

199
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.775
special quantities
like 3D rotations

200
00:06:13.775 --> 00:06:15.515
as we'll see later
in the course.

201
00:06:15.515 --> 00:06:16.850
In the next video,

202
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:17.990
we'll discuss some of

203
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.075
the shortcomings
of the EKF,

204
00:06:20.075 --> 00:06:21.680
and how local
linearization

205
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.240
can break down creating

206
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.100
a potentially
dangerous situation

207
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.210
for a self-driving car.
