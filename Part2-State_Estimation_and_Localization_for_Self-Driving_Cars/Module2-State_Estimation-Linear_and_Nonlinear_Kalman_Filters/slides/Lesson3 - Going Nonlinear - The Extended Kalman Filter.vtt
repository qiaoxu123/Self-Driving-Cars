00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.275
So far in this module,

2
00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:18.330
you've learned how to use
the linear Kalman filter

3
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.070
for state estimation and you

4
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.110
also saw that the Kalman
filter is the best

5
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.630
linear unbiased estimator or blue.

6
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.880
However, the linear Kalman filter

7
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.100
cannot be used directly
to estimate states that

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.675
are nonlinear functions of either
the measurements or the control inputs.

9
00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:36.210
For example, the pose of the car includes

10
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.210
its orientation which is
not a linear quantity,

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.225
orientations in 3D live
on a sphere, in fact.

12
00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:44.675
So, we need to look for something else.

13
00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:46.610
In this video, we'll be learning about

14
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.890
one important and widely
used variation of

15
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.245
a Kalman filter called
the Extended Kalman Filter or EKF.

16
00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:55.410
The EKF is designed to work with

17
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.480
nonlinear systems and it's often
considered one of the workhorses

18
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.270
of state estimation because it's used in

19
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.145
all sorts of applications
including self-driving cars.

20
00:01:06.145 --> 00:01:08.125
By the end of the video,

21
00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:11.630
you'll be able to
describe how the EKF uses

22
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.750
first-order linearization to turn
a nonlinear problem into a linear one,

23
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.700
understand the role of Jacobian matrices

24
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.255
in the EKF and how to compute them,

25
00:01:22.255 --> 00:01:28.130
and apply the EKF to
a simple nonlinear tracking problem.

26
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.300
The filter works by first predicting

27
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300
the mean and co-variance of
the updated state estimate at

28
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.280
some time step k based on

29
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.340
the previous state and any inputs
we give to the system,

30
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.965
such as the position of
the accelerator pedal.

31
00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:45.860
The filter then uses a
measurement model to

32
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.290
predict what measurements
should arrive based on

33
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.930
the state estimate and compares
these predictions with

34
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.365
the measurements that actually
arrive from our sensors.

35
00:01:54.365 --> 00:01:59.580
The Kalman gain tells us how to weight
all of these pieces of information,

36
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.305
so that we can optimally combine
them into a corrected estimate,

37
00:02:03.305 --> 00:02:06.695
that is, a new state and
an updated co-variance.

38
00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:10.600
This is sometimes called a
predictor-corrector architecture.

39
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.415
As we saw in the last video,

40
00:02:12.415 --> 00:02:14.570
the Kalman filter is actually the best

41
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.645
of all possible estimators
for linear systems.

42
00:02:17.645 --> 00:02:19.850
Unfortunately, there is a catch.

43
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.775
Linear systems don't exist in reality.

44
00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.980
Even a very simple system like

45
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.880
a resistor with a voltage
applied isn't truly linear,

46
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.680
at least not all the time.

47
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.990
For a certain range of voltages,

48
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.785
the current is a linear function of
the voltage and follows Ohm's Law.

49
00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:38.690
But as the voltage gets higher,

50
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.860
the resistor heats up which alters
the resistance in a nonlinear way.

51
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.205
Since the systems that we encounter
in practice are nonlinear,

52
00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:48.365
this raises an important question.

53
00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:51.305
Can we still use the Kalman filter
for nonlinear systems?

54
00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:54.060
If so, how?

55
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.120
The key concept in
the Extended Kalman Filter

56
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.400
is the idea of linearizing
a nonlinear system.

57
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.830
For this reason, the EKF is sometimes

58
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.060
referred to as the
Linearized Kalman filter.

59
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.840
Linearizing a system just means
picking some operating point a and

60
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.730
finding a linear approximation to

61
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.495
the nonlinear function in
the neighborhood of a.

62
00:03:19.495 --> 00:03:22.640
In two dimensions, this means
finding the tangent line to

63
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.075
the function f of x when x equals a.

64
00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:28.340
Mathematically, we do this by taking

65
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.500
the Taylor series expansion
of the function.

66
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.700
Thinking back to your calculus courses,

67
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.570
you may remember that
the Taylor series expansion is a way of

68
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.005
representing a function
as an infinite possibly,

69
00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:41.120
some whose terms are calculated

70
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.475
from the function's derivatives
at a single point.

71
00:03:43.475 --> 00:03:45.740
For linearization, we're
only interested in

72
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.610
the first order terms of the Taylor
series expansion highlighted in red.

73
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.710
Let's return to
our general nonlinear motion

74
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.455
and measurement models and
try to linearize them.

75
00:03:57.455 --> 00:04:01.190
What should we choose as the operating
point for our Taylor's expansion?

76
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.820
Ideally, we would like to linearize
the models about the true value of

77
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.455
the state but we can't do that

78
00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:08.390
because we already knew
the true value of the state,

79
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.995
we wouldn't need to estimate it.

80
00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:12.625
So instead, let's pick
the next best thing,

81
00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:14.895
the most recent estimate of the state.

82
00:04:14.895 --> 00:04:16.530
For our emotion model,

83
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.055
we'll linearize about
the posterior estimate

84
00:04:19.055 --> 00:04:21.860
of the previous state and
for the measurement model,

85
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.110
we'll linearize about our prediction of

86
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.665
the current state based
on the motion model.

87
00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:30.870
So, now we have a linear system in
state space and the matrices F,

88
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.690
L, H and M are called Jacobian
matrices of the system.

89
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.790
Computing these matrices correctly is

90
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.190
the most important and difficult step

91
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.410
in the Extended Kalman filter algorithm,

92
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.410
and it's also the most common
place to make mistakes.

93
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.515
But what are these
Jacobian matrix exactly?

94
00:04:48.515 --> 00:04:53.480
In vector calculus, a Jacobian
or Jacobian matrix is

95
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.570
the matrix of all
first-order partial derivatives

96
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.400
of a vector valued function.

97
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.220
Each column of the Jacobian
contains the derivatives of

98
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.595
the function outputs with
respect to a given input.

99
00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:06.575
For example, if your function takes

100
00:05:06.575 --> 00:05:09.920
a three-dimensional vector and
spits out a two-dimensional vector,

101
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.210
the Jacobian would be
a two by three matrix.

102
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.060
Intuitively, the Jacobian matrix
tells you how fast each output of

103
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.780
your function is changing
along each input dimension,

104
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.720
just like how the derivative
of a scalar function tells

105
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.080
you how fast the output is
changing as you vary the input.

106
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.630
The Jacobian is really
just a generalization

107
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.210
of the first derivative
to multiple dimensions.

108
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.940
Here's a simple example
of the Jacobian of

109
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.895
a two-dimensional function
with two inputs.

110
00:05:37.895 --> 00:05:41.480
The Jacobian matrix captures
the first derivatives of each of

111
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.515
the two output variables with respect
to each of the two input variables.

112
00:05:45.515 --> 00:05:49.175
The best way to get comfortable with
driving Jacobian is just practice.

113
00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:53.220
Try deriving the Jacobian of
this vector valued function.

114
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.270
Now, we know how to compute the
Jacobian matrices needed for the EKF,

115
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.200
and all that's left is to plug them

116
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.360
into our standard Kalman
filter equations.

117
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.430
There are a couple of
differences to notice in

118
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.960
the EKF equations compared to

119
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.540
the Kalman filter equations
we saw in module two.

120
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.680
First, in the prediction
and correction steps,

121
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.530
we're still using the nonlinear models
to propagate the mean of

122
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.670
the state estimate and to compute
the measurement residual or innovation.

123
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.055
That's because we
linearized our motion model

124
00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:30.210
about the previous state estimate,

125
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.800
and we linearized the measurement model
about the predicted state.

126
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.830
By definition,
the linearized model exactly

127
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.905
coincides with the nonlinear model
at the operating points.

128
00:06:39.905 --> 00:06:41.750
The second difference
is the appearance of

129
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.505
the L and M Jacobians related to
the process and measurement noise.

130
00:06:46.505 --> 00:06:50.300
In many cases, both of these matrices
will be identity since

131
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.960
noise is often assumed to be additive
but this is not always the case.

132
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.140
So far, this has all been very abstract.

133
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.265
So, let's walk through a concrete
example of actually using the EKF.

134
00:07:04.265 --> 00:07:08.000
We'll use the same example from
module two but with a twist.

135
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.620
We're going to track the position and

136
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.840
velocity of a car moving along a rail.

137
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.580
But now, instead of receiving

138
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.270
periodic GPS measurements
that tell us our position,

139
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.475
we're going to use
an on-board sensor like a camera

140
00:07:19.475 --> 00:07:22.940
to measure the altitude of distant
landmarks relative to the horizon.

141
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.050
We'll keep the same linear motion model
as in the original example,

142
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.760
and assume we know both the height of

143
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.735
the landmark and its position
in a global reference frame.

144
00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:35.630
Because our sensor is measuring an angle,

145
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.770
our measurement model has

146
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.725
a nonlinear dependence on
the position of the car.

147
00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:41.540
We're going to need to linearize

148
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.885
the measurement model and use it
in our Extended Kalman Filter.

149
00:07:44.885 --> 00:07:48.350
The Jacobians for
this problem look like this.

150
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.080
Notice that the F matrix
in this problem is

151
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.275
exactly the same as the F matrix
in the original problem.

152
00:07:54.275 --> 00:07:58.585
That's because our motion model
is already linear in the state.

153
00:07:58.585 --> 00:08:01.875
Also notice that
the noise Jacobians, L and M,

154
00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:03.620
are both identity since

155
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.830
both the emotion and the measurement
model have additive noise.

156
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.890
Try using the data given here
to estimate the position of

157
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.960
the vehicle at time one using the EKF.

158
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.800
Here is the result of the prediction step

159
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.795
for the mean and
co-variance of the state.

160
00:08:20.795 --> 00:08:23.090
Notice that the result is identical to

161
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.840
the linear Kalman filter case because
the motion model actually is linear.

162
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.865
For the correction step,

163
00:08:29.865 --> 00:08:31.520
this is what you should get.

164
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.530
Keep in mind that you should use

165
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.460
the nonlinear measurement model to
compute the measurement residual,

166
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.530
not the linearized model.

167
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.800
Also note that in this case,

168
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.280
even though the corrected mean at

169
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.100
the state estimate is different
from the predicted mean,

170
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.470
the corrected co-variance didn't change

171
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.395
that much from the predicted co-variance.

172
00:08:51.395 --> 00:08:56.090
This is because the Azimuth angle
changes slowly at this distance

173
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.040
and doesn't provide
much information about

174
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.605
the vehicle state compared
to a GPS measurement.

175
00:09:01.605 --> 00:09:06.704
So, to recap, we saw that
the Extended Kalman Filter or EKF

176
00:09:06.704 --> 00:09:11.630
uses linearization to adopt
the Kalman filter to nonlinear systems.

177
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.390
We'll encounter several
different nonlinear systems

178
00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.700
to which we can apply
the EKF or its cousin,

179
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.720
the UKF, in the upcoming course project.

180
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.960
Linearization works by computing
a local linear approximation to

181
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.460
a nonlinear function using

182
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.865
a first-order Taylor series expansion
about an operating point.

183
00:09:28.865 --> 00:09:31.445
This requires several Jacobian matrices

184
00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:35.105
which contain the set of
first-order partial derivatives.

185
00:09:35.105 --> 00:09:37.070
In the next video,

186
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.200
we'll discuss an
alternative formulation of

187
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.845
the EKF called the error
state Extended Kalman Filter.

188
00:09:42.845 --> 00:09:46.040
This would be a useful tool later
in the course when we talk about

189
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.130
estimating the vehicle
orientation in 3D space.
