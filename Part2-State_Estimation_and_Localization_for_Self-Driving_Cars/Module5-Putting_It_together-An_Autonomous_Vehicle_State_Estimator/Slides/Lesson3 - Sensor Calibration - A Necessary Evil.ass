00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.710
Now that we've seen
how we can combine

2
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.360
multiple sources
of sensor data

3
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.905
to estimate
the vehicle state,

4
00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:21.900
it's time to address
a topic that we've

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.165
so far been sweeping
under the rug.

6
00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:26.385
That topic is
Sensor Calibration,

7
00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:27.660
and it's one of
those things that

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.010
engineers don't
really like

9
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.020
talking about but
it's absolutely

10
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.190
essential for doing state

11
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.330
estimation properly.

12
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.890
Personally, calibration

13
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.000
is near and dear
to me since

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.890
my doctoral
research focused on

15
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.065
calibration for
cameras and IMUs,

16
00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:41.570
and it's a topic
that my students are

17
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.235
continuing to
research today.

18
00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:45.050
In this video,
we'll discuss

19
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.239
the three main types
of sensor calibration

20
00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.260
and why we need to

21
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.370
think about
them when we're

22
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.750
designing
a state estimator

23
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.880
for a self-driving car.

24
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.900
The three main types
of calibration will

25
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.000
talk about are
intrinsic calibration,

26
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.540
which deals with

27
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.400
sensors specific
parameters,

28
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.990
extrinsic calibration,

29
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.700
which deals with
how the sensors are

30
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.045
positioned and oriented
on the vehicle,

31
00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:06.530
and temporal calibration,
which deals with

32
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.760
the time offset between

33
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.605
different sensor
measurements.

34
00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:12.845
Let's look at intrinsic
calibration first.

35
00:01:12.845 --> 00:01:15.095
In intrinsic calibration,

36
00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:15.980
we want to determine

37
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.590
the fixed parameters
of our sensor models,

38
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.670
so that we can use them in

39
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.420
an estimator like

40
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.565
an extended Kalman filter.

41
00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:24.950
Every sensor
has parameters

42
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.090
associated with
it that are

43
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.100
unique to that
specific sensor and

44
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.515
are typically expected
to be constant.

45
00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:32.090
For example, we might have

46
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.740
an encoder attached
to one axle of

47
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.940
the car that measures

48
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.250
the wheel rotation
rate omega.

49
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.560
If we want to use
omega to estimate

50
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.750
the forward velocity
v of the wheel,

51
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.560
we would need to know

52
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.300
the radius R of the wheel,

53
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.460
so that we can use
this in the equation v

54
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.370
equals omega times
R. In this case,

55
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.570
R is a parameter of

56
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.010
the sensor model
that is specific

57
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.060
to the wheel the encoder

58
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.830
is attached to
and we might

59
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.230
have a different R for
a different wheel.

60
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.790
Another example of an

61
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.170
intrinsic sensor
parameter is

62
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.310
the elevation angle of

63
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.450
a scan line in

64
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.715
a LiDAR sensor
like the Velodyne.

65
00:02:04.715 --> 00:02:06.590
The elevation angle
is a fixed

66
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.910
quantity but we
need to know it

67
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.930
ahead of time
so that we can

68
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.425
properly interpret
each scan.

69
00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:12.950
So, how do we determine

70
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.645
intrinsic parameters
like these?

71
00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:16.070
Well, there are
a few practical

72
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.990
strategies for doing this.

73
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.910
The easiest one
is just let

74
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.950
the manufacturer
do it for you.

75
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.320
Often, sensors
are calibrated

76
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.465
in the factory and
come with a spec sheet

77
00:02:26.465 --> 00:02:27.800
that tells you
all the numbers

78
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.520
you need to plug into

79
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.390
your model to make

80
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.030
sense of the measurements.

81
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.155
This is usually
a good starting point

82
00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:34.670
but it won't always
be good enough

83
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.010
to do really accurate
state estimation

84
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.690
because no two sensors are

85
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.310
exactly alike
and there'll be

86
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.540
some variation in the true

87
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.860
values of the parameters.

88
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.430
Another easy strategy
that involves

89
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.840
a little more work
is to try

90
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.195
measuring these
parameters by hand.

91
00:02:50.195 --> 00:02:51.890
This is pretty
straightforward

92
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.150
for something like a tire,

93
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.405
but not so straightforward

94
00:02:54.405 --> 00:02:55.949
for something like a LiDAR

95
00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:57.740
where it's not exactly
practical to poke

96
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.265
around with a protractor
inside the sensor.

97
00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:03.350
A more sophisticated
approach

98
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.730
involves estimating

99
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.930
the intrinsic
parameters as

100
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.520
part of the vehicle state,

101
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.650
either on the fly
or more commonly as

102
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.135
a special calibration step

103
00:03:11.135 --> 00:03:14.110
before putting the
sensors into operation.

104
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.700
This approach has

105
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.600
the advantage of producing

106
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.340
an accurate
calibration that's

107
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.395
specific to
the particular sensor

108
00:03:20.395 --> 00:03:21.760
and can also be
formulated in

109
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.380
a way that can handle
the parameters

110
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.180
varying slowly over time.

111
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.600
For example, if
you continually

112
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.550
estimate the radius
of your tires,

113
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.540
this could be
a good way of

114
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.800
detecting when
you have a flat.

115
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.225
Now,

116
00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:36.790
because the estimators
we've talked about

117
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.980
in this course are
general purpose,

118
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.600
we already have
the tools to do

119
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.850
this kind of
automatic calibration.

120
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.950
To see how this works,
let's come back to

121
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.910
our example of a car

122
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.420
moving in one dimension.

123
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.090
So, we've attached
an encoder to

124
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.290
the back wheel to

125
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.330
measure the wheel
rotation rate.

126
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.950
If we want to estimate

127
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.120
the wheel radius along

128
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.599
with position
and velocity,

129
00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.070
all we need to
do is add it to

130
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.360
the state vector and

131
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.680
work out what
the new motion and

132
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.005
observation model
should be.

133
00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:05.420
For the motion model,
everything is the

134
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.890
same as before except

135
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.210
now there's
an extra row and

136
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.620
column in the matrix
that says that

137
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.330
the wheel radius
should stay

138
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.165
constant from one
time step to the next.

139
00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:15.875
For the observation model,

140
00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:17.240
we're still
observing position

141
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.935
directly through GPS

142
00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:20.600
but now we're
also observing

143
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.680
the wheel rotation rate

144
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.780
through the encoder.

145
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.140
So, we include the extra

146
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.810
non-linear observation
in the model.

147
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.580
From here, we can use

148
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.620
the extended or
unscented Kalman filter

149
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.330
to estimate
the wheel radius along

150
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.960
with the position and

151
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.555
velocity of the vehicle.

152
00:04:34.555 --> 00:04:36.350
So, intrinsic calibration

153
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.490
is essential for doing

154
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.520
state estimation with
even a single sensor.

155
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.080
But extrinsic calibration

156
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.220
is equally important for

157
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.705
fusing information
from multiple sensors.

158
00:04:46.705 --> 00:04:49.074
In extrinsic calibration,

159
00:04:49.074 --> 00:04:49.790
we're interested in

160
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.740
determining the relative
poses of all of

161
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.360
the sensors usually with

162
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.295
respect to
the vehicle frame.

163
00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.440
For example, we
need to know

164
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.945
the relative pose of
the IMU and the LiDAR.

165
00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:01.400
So, the rates reported by

166
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.750
the IMU are expressed in

167
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.415
the same coordinate system

168
00:05:04.415 --> 00:05:06.500
as the LiDAR point clouds.

169
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.750
Just like with
intrinsic calibration,

170
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.890
there are different
techniques

171
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.070
for doing extrinsic
calibration.

172
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.360
If you're lucky, you
might have access to

173
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.500
an accurate CAD model of

174
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.720
the vehicle like this one,

175
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.140
where all of
the sensor frames

176
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.570
have been nicely
laid out for you.

177
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.900
If you're less
lucky, you might be

178
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.815
tempted to try
measuring by hand.

179
00:05:24.815 --> 00:05:26.455
Unfortunately,
this is often

180
00:05:26.455 --> 00:05:27.880
difficult or
impossible to do

181
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.100
accurately since
many sensors have

182
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.615
the origin of
their coordinate system

183
00:05:31.615 --> 00:05:33.260
inside the sensor itself,

184
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.840
and you probably don't
want to dismantle

185
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.075
your car and all
of the sensors.

186
00:05:37.075 --> 00:05:38.920
Fortunately, we can use

187
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.000
a similar trick
to estimate

188
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.560
the extrinsic
parameters by

189
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.045
including them
in our state.

190
00:05:43.045 --> 00:05:44.950
This can become a
bit complicated

191
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.095
for arbitrary sensor
configurations,

192
00:05:47.095 --> 00:05:47.830
and there is still

193
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.300
a lot of research
being done

194
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.410
into different techniques

195
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.580
for doing this reliably.

196
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.330
Finally, an
often overlooked

197
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.200
but still important type

198
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.945
of calibration is
temporal calibration.

199
00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:00.280
In all of
our discussion of

200
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.510
multisensory fusion,

201
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.175
we've been
implicitly assuming

202
00:06:03.175 --> 00:06:04.430
that all of the
measurements we've

203
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.960
combined are captured

204
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.310
exactly the same moment in

205
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.050
time or at least

206
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.690
close enough for a given
level of accuracy.

207
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.560
But how do we

208
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.985
decide whether
two measurements

209
00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:14.870
are close enough to be

210
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.895
considered synchronized?

211
00:06:16.895 --> 00:06:18.740
Well, the obvious
thing to do

212
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.015
would just be to timestamp

213
00:06:20.015 --> 00:06:21.380
each measurement
when the on-board

214
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.760
computer receives it,

215
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.930
and match up the
measurements

216
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.535
that are closest
to each other.

217
00:06:25.535 --> 00:06:28.040
For example, if we
get LiDAR scans at

218
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.815
15 hertz and IMU
readings at 200 hertz,

219
00:06:30.815 --> 00:06:33.260
we might want to pair
each LiDAR scan with

220
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.955
the IMU reading
whose timestamp

221
00:06:34.955 --> 00:06:36.485
is the closest match.

222
00:06:36.485 --> 00:06:38.210
But in reality, there's

223
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.010
an unknown delay
between when the LiDAR

224
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.660
or IMU actually records

225
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.040
an observation and when

226
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.095
it arrives at
the computer.

227
00:06:45.095 --> 00:06:47.080
These delays can be caused

228
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.130
by the time it takes for

229
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.060
the sensor data to be

230
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.900
transmitted to
the host computer,

231
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.440
or by pre-processing steps

232
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.360
performed by
the sensor circuitry,

233
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.810
and the delay
can be different

234
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.715
for different sensors.

235
00:06:57.715 --> 00:06:59.365
So, if we want to get

236
00:06:59.365 --> 00:07:01.630
a really accurate
state estimate,

237
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.220
we need to think
about how well

238
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.300
our sensors are
actually synchronized,

239
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.730
and there are
different ways

240
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.725
to approach this.

241
00:07:08.725 --> 00:07:11.410
The simplest and most
common thing to do

242
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.705
is just to assume
the delay is zero.

243
00:07:13.705 --> 00:07:14.740
You can still get

244
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.180
a working estimator
this way,

245
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.140
but the results may be

246
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.400
less accurate than
what you would

247
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.800
get with a better
temporal calibration.

248
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.760
Another common
strategy is to use

249
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.140
hardware timing signals

250
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.820
to synchronize
the sensors,

251
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.630
but this is often
an option only for

252
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.075
more expensive
sensor setups.

253
00:07:32.075 --> 00:07:33.905
As you may have guessed,

254
00:07:33.905 --> 00:07:36.170
it's also possible
to try estimating

255
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.490
these time delays as

256
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.960
part of the vehicle state,

257
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.700
but this can get
complicated.

258
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.590
In fact, an
entire chapter of

259
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.450
my PhD dissertation
was dedicated to

260
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.985
solving this temporal
calibration problem

261
00:07:46.985 --> 00:07:49.315
for a camera IMU pair.

262
00:07:49.315 --> 00:07:51.530
So, we have seen
the different types of

263
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.970
calibration we
should be thinking

264
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.830
about when designing
an estimator

265
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.330
for a self-driving car,

266
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.830
but how much of
a difference does

267
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.285
good calibration really
make in practice?

268
00:08:01.285 --> 00:08:04.055
Here's a video comparing
the results of

269
00:08:04.055 --> 00:08:06.635
good calibration
and bad calibration

270
00:08:06.635 --> 00:08:08.885
for a LiDAR mapping task.

271
00:08:08.885 --> 00:08:11.105
You'll notice in
the video that

272
00:08:11.105 --> 00:08:13.400
the point cloud in
the calibrated case is

273
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.230
much more crisp than

274
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.660
the point cloud in
the uncalibrated case.

275
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.280
In the uncalibrated case,

276
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.885
the point cloud is fuzzy,

277
00:08:20.885 --> 00:08:22.280
it's smeared and you

278
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.930
may see objects that are

279
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.640
repeated or objects that

280
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.205
are in fact
entirely missed,

281
00:08:27.205 --> 00:08:30.320
because the LiDAR is
not correctly aligned

282
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.805
with the inertial sensor.

283
00:08:31.805 --> 00:08:34.370
To summarize,
sensor fusion

284
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.140
is impossible
without calibration.

285
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.250
In this video, you

286
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.715
learned about
intrinsic calibration,

287
00:08:41.715 --> 00:08:42.920
which deals with
calibrating

288
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.305
the parameters of
our sensor models.

289
00:08:45.305 --> 00:08:47.450
Extrinsic calibration,
which gives

290
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.130
us the coordinate
transformations we

291
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.305
need to transform
sensor measurements

292
00:08:51.305 --> 00:08:53.530
into a common
reference frame.

293
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.255
Temporal calibration,

294
00:08:55.255 --> 00:08:56.569
which deals with
synchronizing

295
00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:58.490
measurements to
ensure they all

296
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.595
correspond to
the same vehicle state.

297
00:09:01.595 --> 00:09:02.510
While there are

298
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.860
some standard
techniques for

299
00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.570
solving all of
these problems,

300
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:06.890
calibration is still very

301
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.675
much an active area
of research.

302
00:09:08.675 --> 00:09:09.980
In the next video, we'll

303
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.000
take a look at
what happens

304
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.310
when one or more of
our sensors fails,

305
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.300
and how we can ensure that

306
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.590
a self-driving car is

307
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.880
able to continue
to operate

308
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.170
safely in these cases.
