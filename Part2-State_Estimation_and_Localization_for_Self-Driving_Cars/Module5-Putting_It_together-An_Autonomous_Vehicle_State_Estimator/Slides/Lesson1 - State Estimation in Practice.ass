1
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.955
Now, that you've learned the basics of estimation theory,

2
00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:27.225
3D geometry, and some common sensing modalities,

3
00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:31.110
it's time to put it into practice and think about how we can use all of these tools

4
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.300
together to build an estimator we can use on a real self-driving car.

5
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.865
A real self-driving car like the autonomous

6
00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:40.685
will be equipped with many different kinds of sensors.

7
00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:45.665
For example, the autonomous is equipped with five cameras, a 3D LiDAR,

8
00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:48.320
an IMU, four radar units,

9
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.295
a GPS or GNSS receiver, and a wheel encoder.

10
00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:56.420
All of these sensors give us different types of data at different rates.

11
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.030
For example, the IMU might report accelerations

12
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.595
and angular velocities 200 times per second,

13
00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:06.205
while the LiDAR completes a full scan only 20 times per second.

14
00:01:06.205 --> 00:01:09.605
So, in this module, we're going to talk about how we can combine

15
00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:15.170
all the different information to get the best possible estimate of the vehicle state.

16
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.170
This process is called sensor fusion and it's one of

17
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.810
the most important techniques for self-driving cars.

18
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.065
But in order to do sensor fusion,

19
00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:27.890
we also need to calibrate our sensors to ensure that the sensor models are

20
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.630
accurate and so that we know how

21
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.530
the reference frames of all of the sensors are related to each other.

22
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.830
We'll also discuss what happens when one or more sensors

23
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.680
fails and give you an overview of

24
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.395
the final project where you'll have an opportunity to implement

25
00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:46.655
a full vehicle state estimator using sensors in the Carlo simulator.

26
00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:48.140
In this first video,

27
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.380
we'll give you a bird's-eye view of some practical considerations you

28
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.340
should take into account when designing systems for self-driving cars.

29
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.290
What kind of considerations?

30
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.215
Well, we've already touched on sensor fusion and calibration,

31
00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:04.160
but we'll also need to think about speed and accuracy requirements as well as

32
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.710
localization failures and how to cope with

33
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.115
parts of the environment that are moving and changing around us.

34
00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:12.380
Let's start with sensor fusion.

35
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.925
If we have a car like the autonomous that's equipped with a number of different sensors,

36
00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:19.610
what we would like to do is figure out how to combine all of

37
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.725
this different information to get the best possible estimate of the vehicle state.

38
00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:28.429
It might seem like a daunting task to fuse all of this data,

39
00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.295
but in fact, we already have the tools to do this.

40
00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:33.050
In lesson two of this module,

41
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.700
we'll discuss exactly how we can use

42
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.620
the familiar tools like the extended Kalman filter to

43
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.235
combine all of the sensor data into a single consistent estimate of the vehicle state.

44
00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:45.530
But in order to do sensor fusion,

45
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.180
we first need to know some things about

46
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.875
our sensors and how they're configured on board the vehicle.

47
00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:54.380
For one thing, our sensor models might depend on parameters

48
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.725
that are specific to the car or to the sensor itself.

49
00:02:57.725 --> 00:03:03.080
A good example of this is using wheel encoders to measure the forward speed of the car.

50
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.860
A wheel encoder measures the angular velocity of the axle.

51
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.475
But if we want to use that to get the forward velocity of the vehicle,

52
00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:13.390
we also need to know the radius of a tire.

53
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.410
Another thing we need to know about the vehicle is the pose or position and

54
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.430
orientation of each sensor relative to the vehicle reference frame.

55
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.630
Because we're combining information from sensors located in different places,

56
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.895
we need to know how to transform all of the measurements

57
00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:30.635
so they're expressed in a common reference frame.

58
00:03:30.635 --> 00:03:33.580
Finally, we need to think about how well our sensor measurements are

59
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.550
synchronized so that we can fuse them all properly.

60
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.340
Intuitively, you might expect that directly combining

61
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.450
a LiDAR scan you just received with a GPS measurement you received, say,

62
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.945
five seconds ago, won't produce as good of a result

63
00:03:46.945 --> 00:03:51.160
as if the LiDAR scan and the GPS measurement were taken at the same time.

64
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.100
So, the more accurately you can synchronize your sensors,

65
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.485
the better your state estimate will be.

66
00:03:56.485 --> 00:04:00.830
A part of this involves determining the time offset between when the sensor

67
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.940
records a measurement and when the estimator receives it for processing.

68
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.870
All of these factors are critical forms of

69
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.995
calibration which we'll discuss in more detail in lesson three.

70
00:04:12.995 --> 00:04:15.920
How accurate does a estimator need to be for

71
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.670
a self-driving car to drive safely on the road?

72
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.105
Well, it depends on the size of the car,

73
00:04:21.105 --> 00:04:22.140
the width of the lanes,

74
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.669
and the density of traffic,

75
00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.315
but to get a ballpark estimate,

76
00:04:25.315 --> 00:04:29.480
you might consider the margin of error available for a task leak lane keeping.

77
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.500
A typical car is about 1.8 meters wide,

78
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.310
an average highway lane might be about three meters wide, give or take.

79
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.530
So, our estimator would need to be good enough to position the car within

80
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.650
60 centimeters or so on either side of the lane.

81
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.695
That's assuming we know exactly where the lanes are and that there's no traffic.

82
00:04:47.695 --> 00:04:51.530
For comparison, an optimistic range for GPS accuracy is

83
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.205
between one and five meters depending on the specific hardware,

84
00:04:55.205 --> 00:04:58.290
the number of satellites that are visible, and other factors.

85
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.450
So, clearly, GPS alone is not enough even for lane keeping.

86
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.430
This is one important reason why we'll need to

87
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.580
combine information from many different sensors.

88
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.020
What about speed? How fast we need to update the vehicles states whether

89
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.855
the car can react to rapidly changing environments or unexpected events?

90
00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:20.560
Well, this all depends on what kind of environment the car is operating in.

91
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.790
Imagine that you're driving a car with your eyes closed,

92
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.600
and you open your eyes exactly once every second to

93
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.110
take a look at what's around you and make some adjustments.

94
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.935
This corresponds to an update rate of one hertz.

95
00:05:33.935 --> 00:05:37.340
For driving down a street country road with no traffic in sight,

96
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.830
maybe you'll feel relatively safe doing this.

97
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.640
But what if you're driving through a busy city intersection with dozens of other cars,

98
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.780
and buses, and cyclists,

99
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.460
and pedestrians around you?

100
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.770
You would probably feel much less safe opening your eyes once a second.

101
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.360
As a rule of thumb,

102
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.020
an update rate of 15 hertz to 30 hertz is a reasonable target for self-driving.

103
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.780
But of course, there's a trade-off to think about here.

104
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.490
A self-driving car will only have

105
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.450
so much on-board computing power available and the computer will need to juggle

106
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.910
many different processes like control and

107
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.510
path planning and perception in addition to state estimation.

108
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.680
What's more, the total amount of compute power available on board may be limited

109
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.600
by restrictions on how much power the computer is actually allowed to consume.

110
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.100
Produce state estimation with fixed computational resources,

111
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.200
there's a trade-off between how complicated our algorithms can

112
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.225
be and the amount of time are allowed to spend computing a solution.

113
00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:34.490
It's up to you as a self-driving car engineer to

114
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.645
decide where your car is going to be on this trade off curve.

115
00:06:38.645 --> 00:06:41.990
Even if we had a fast and accurate estimation algorithm,

116
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.235
there are going to be cases where our localization might fail. How could this happen?

117
00:06:47.235 --> 00:06:48.820
Well, for one thing,

118
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.300
we might have one or more of our sensors report bad data or maybe even fail entirely.

119
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.590
A good example of this is GPS which doesn't work at all in tunnels and which

120
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.120
can have a difficult time coping with

121
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.330
reflected signals in cities with a lot of tall buildings.

122
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.755
We might also encounter errors in our state estimation algorithm itself.

123
00:07:06.755 --> 00:07:08.630
For example, if we're using

124
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.840
an extended common filter with a highly nonlinear sensor model,

125
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.850
we might find that the inherent linearization error in the estimator means that we can

126
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.230
lose accuracy in our state estimate

127
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.475
even though the estimator is pretty confident in its output.

128
00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:26.015
Or maybe, our estimator is not very confident at all.

129
00:07:26.015 --> 00:07:28.430
Thinking back to the Kalman filter equations,

130
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.590
you might remember that the uncertainty in our state

131
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.770
grows as we propagate forward through the motion model and it

132
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:40.470
only shrinks once we incorporate outside observations from LiDAR or GPS for example.

133
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.795
If our LiDAR is broken and we're driving in a tunnel without GPS,

134
00:07:44.795 --> 00:07:47.720
how long can we rely on an IMU and a motion model before

135
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.560
our estate uncertainty grows too large and it's no longer safe to drive?

136
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.820
We'll talk about strategies for detecting and coping with

137
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.480
localization failures like these in lesson four.

138
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.230
Finally, we need to think about the world the car lives in.

139
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.660
For the most part, we've developed our models for sensors like

140
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.620
LiDAR under the assumption that the world is static and unchanging.

141
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.375
But of course, in reality,

142
00:08:11.375 --> 00:08:13.625
the world is always moving and changing.

143
00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:15.765
For example, other cars,

144
00:08:15.765 --> 00:08:18.860
pedestrians, and cyclists are probably moving.

145
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.680
Lighting changes over the course of a day and

146
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.895
even the geometry of the world can change with the seasons.

147
00:08:24.895 --> 00:08:27.860
One of the big challenges for self-driving cars is

148
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.845
finding ways to account for these kinds of changes,

149
00:08:30.845 --> 00:08:33.230
whether by modeling them or by finding ways of

150
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:37.145
identifying and ignoring objects that violate our assumptions.

151
00:08:37.145 --> 00:08:41.465
In fact, this is still a very active area of research.

152
00:08:41.465 --> 00:08:44.435
So, to summarize this video,

153
00:08:44.435 --> 00:08:48.380
state estimation in practice will typically rely on sensor fusion to

154
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.940
combine information from many different kinds of sensors,

155
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.735
like IMUs, LiDAR, cameras,

156
00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:57.865
and GPS or GNSS receivers.

157
00:08:57.865 --> 00:09:00.770
In order for sensor fusion to work as intended,

158
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.420
we need to calibrate the sensors by determining the parameters of our sensor models.

159
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.480
The relative positions and orientations of all of

160
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.395
the sensors and any differences in polling times.

161
00:09:12.395 --> 00:09:16.310
We also need to consider trade-offs between speed and accuracy in

162
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.290
our algorithms which may be different

163
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.365
depending on the type of self-driving car you're working on.

164
00:09:21.365 --> 00:09:24.710
Ask yourself, how accurately do I need to know

165
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:30.245
the vehicle state and how often do I need to update it for my particular use case?

166
00:09:30.245 --> 00:09:34.820
Finally, we need to think about how to safely cope with localization failures and

167
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.880
aspects of the world that do not conform to our assumptions such as moving objects.

168
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.770
In the next three videos, we'll dig into some of these topics in

169
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:47.070
more detail starting with multi-sensory fusion in the next video.
