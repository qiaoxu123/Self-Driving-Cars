00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.190
If you've ever had to create any sort
of moving robotics platform,

2
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.285
you'll probably recall how finicky
any piece of hardware can be.

3
00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:25.105
Sensing hardware is no different.

4
00:00:25.105 --> 00:00:28.900
In long-term autonomy applications
like self-driving vehicles,

5
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.070
sensors can malfunction or dropout
for a number of different reasons,

6
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.100
like weather damage, firmware failures,

7
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.255
or something as simple as a loose wire.

8
00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:40.360
We've seen in this module that even if

9
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.685
all of our sensors are working normally,

10
00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:44.210
it's still beneficial to have

11
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.550
multiple complimentary sensors to

12
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.255
provide robust accurate
localization estimates.

13
00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:53.200
But what happens if one
of the sensors fails?

14
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.270
So far, we've discussed
GNSS receivers, IMUs, and Lidars,

15
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.305
but most modern autonomous vehicles

16
00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:02.975
also includes sensors
like wheel encoders,

17
00:01:02.975 --> 00:01:06.395
radar, sonar, and multiple cameras.

18
00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:08.450
In order to build a safe vehicle,

19
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.805
it's crucial to understand
and characterize

20
00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:13.850
what happens when one or
more sensors malfunctions,

21
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.795
and the minimal sensing we need
to maintain safe operation.

22
00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:21.830
In this lesson, we'll discuss
the importance of sensor redundancy for

23
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.530
robust localization and explore

24
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.145
several examples of sensing
failures in localization.

25
00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:30.350
One important consideration
for this type of

26
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.800
analysis is sensor range
and operating limitations.

27
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.180
A GNSS receiver will not work under

28
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.145
a bridge and may have reduced
accuracy between tall buildings.

29
00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:46.730
An IMU may be sensitive to

30
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.060
temperature and may require
periodic recalibration.

31
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.610
What's more, for sensors that observe

32
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.700
the external world like Lidars, sonar,

33
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.445
cameras, or radars, their sensing range

34
00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:01.930
plays a very important role
in safe operation.

35
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.990
Most cars have long,

36
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.120
medium, and short range sensing.

37
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.725
If one of these malfunctions,

38
00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:09.420
it's often important to restrict

39
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.845
movement so the malfunction
doesn't affect safety.

40
00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:15.280
For example, in localization,

41
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.360
we may use short range sensors for

42
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.320
parking and to ensure we're not
colliding with nearby vehicles.

43
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.780
Medium range sensors may help in

44
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.350
pedestrian and cyclist detection
and in lane keeping.

45
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.170
Longer range sensors
can help us detect and

46
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.320
predict the motion of
approaching distant obstacles.

47
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.985
If one of these fails,

48
00:02:34.985 --> 00:02:38.270
we have to take appropriate action
to ensure that the safety of

49
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.695
the car occupants or the people
around us is not compromised.

50
00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:46.160
This means that a self-driving car
engineer will have to consider

51
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.470
the minimal allowable sensing equipment

52
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.665
necessary to perform each of these steps.

53
00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:54.500
For this type of redundant system design,

54
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.050
we can look at examples
from an industry known for

55
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.965
its rigorous safety standards,
commercial aviation.

56
00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:03.860
As an example of a redundant system,

57
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.475
consider the primary flight computer
of the Boeing 777.

58
00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:11.390
The 777 operates on
a triple redundancy principle.

59
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.285
All major systems, including
this flight computer,

60
00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:16.250
have two backups, each with

61
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.030
independent power and
separate programming and specifications.

62
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.860
Here you can see that each of

63
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.620
the flight computers has
a different processor to

64
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.645
ensure that a bug in
the architecture itself

65
00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:29.725
doesn't affect all three computers.

66
00:03:29.725 --> 00:03:33.045
If one of the computers
fails or malfunctions,

67
00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:38.075
the 777 uses a consensus algorithm
to seamlessly switch to another one.

68
00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:41.440
Although self-driving technology
has come a long way,

69
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.305
we're still only a decade beyond some
of the first self-driving challenges,

70
00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:48.260
like the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge.

71
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.230
Here you can see how a lack
of safety redundancy

72
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.695
leads the MIT and Cornell teams
to crash into each other.

73
00:03:54.695 --> 00:03:57.260
If this crash occurred at higher speeds,

74
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.070
the results may have been much worse.

75
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.340
Taking a more recent example,

76
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.155
here's a car from the 2015

77
00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:06.920
International Driver's Vehicle
Conference that fails to

78
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.870
apply its autonomous breaking

79
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.810
appropriately and crashes
into a blown-up kangaroo.

80
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.340
Finally, consider this now infamous
recording of a Tesla Model S

81
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.350
driving almost straight into a dividing
barrier on a freeway in California.

82
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.875
This was a sobering reminder
that it is crucial

83
00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:30.485
for the engineers and architects
who design self-driving vehicles,

84
00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:35.140
to carefully consider and characterize
the different failure modes of

85
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.080
the different sensing paradigms
used in order to assure

86
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.830
that one malfunctioning component
doesn't cause tragedy.

87
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.700
To summarize, it's always

88
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.130
important to consider
the limitations of any set of

89
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.480
sensors and use multiple complimentary
sensors for robust localization.

90
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.590
That's it for this module.

91
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.290
Next, you'll start your course project,

92
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.980
where you'll use everything
you've learned in this course

93
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.860
to implement a realistic
state-estimation system.
