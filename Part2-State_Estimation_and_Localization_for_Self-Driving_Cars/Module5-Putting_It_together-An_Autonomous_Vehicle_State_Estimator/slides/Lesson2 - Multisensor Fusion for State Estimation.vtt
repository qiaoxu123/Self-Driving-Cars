00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.270
Welcome back. Now
that we've discussed

2
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.770
the basic hardware
and software

3
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.330
that we'll need
for localization,

4
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.340
let's put everything
together.

5
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.990
In this lesson,
we will derive

6
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.070
an error state extended

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.584
Kalman Filter that
estimates position,

8
00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:28.400
velocity,

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.455
and orientation of
a self-driving car

10
00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:32.644
using an IMU,

11
00:00:32.644 --> 00:00:36.370
a GNSS receiver,
and a LIDAR.

12
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.690
Although we'll make
some simplifications,

13
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.910
the basic structure
of our pipeline will

14
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.960
resemble one used in

15
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.165
modern self-driving
vehicles.

16
00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:46.970
Before we dive into
the algorithm details,

17
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.440
it's always useful
to take a step

18
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.060
back and ask, "Why

19
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.770
use these sensors and

20
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.155
can we do something
more simple?"

21
00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:56.920
In our case, we'll
be using an IMU with

22
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.750
a GNSS receiver and

23
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.060
a LIDAR for
several reasons.

24
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.010
First, whenever we fuse

25
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.120
information for
the purpose

26
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.350
of state estimation,

27
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.690
one important factor
to consider is

28
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.430
whether or not the
errors from

29
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.815
different sensors
will be correlated.

30
00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:14.230
In other words,
if one fails is

31
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.780
the other likely
to fail as well.

32
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.930
In this case, all three
of our sensors use

33
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.670
different measurement
methods and are

34
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.445
unlikely to fail for
the same reason.

35
00:01:24.445 --> 00:01:27.280
Second, we should
try our best to

36
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.270
choose sensors that are

37
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.995
complimentary in nature.

38
00:01:29.995 --> 00:01:32.320
In our case,
the IMU acts as

39
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.345
a high-rate
smoother of GPS

40
00:01:34.345 --> 00:01:36.985
or GNSS position
estimates.

41
00:01:36.985 --> 00:01:39.290
GNSS data can mitigate

42
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.275
errors that are
due to IMU drift.

43
00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:44.000
It's also possible to use

44
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.875
wheel odometry
for this purpose.

45
00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:47.630
In this lecture,
we'll stick to

46
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.490
IMUs as they can provide

47
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.900
full position
and orientation

48
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.300
information in
three-dimensions,

49
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.800
whereas wheel odometry is

50
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.190
limited to two dimensions.

51
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.260
Finally, LIDAR
can compliment

52
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.480
GNSS information
by providing

53
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.760
very accurate position
estimates within

54
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.200
a known map and

55
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.705
in sky obstructed
locations.

56
00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:11.240
Conversely, GNSS can tell

57
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.360
LIDAR which map to
use when localizing.

58
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.870
For the purposes of
EKF state estimation,

59
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.070
we can implement either

60
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.240
what's called a loosely

61
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.710
coupled estimator or a
tightly coupled one.

62
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.145
In a tightly coupled EKF,

63
00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:27.440
we use the raw pseudo

64
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.090
range and point cloud
measurements from

65
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.870
our GNSS and LIDAR
as observations.

66
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.215
In a loosely
coupled system,

67
00:02:35.215 --> 00:02:36.980
we assume that this data
has already been

68
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.360
preprocessed to

69
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.925
produce a noisy
position estimate.

70
00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:43.220
Although the tightly
coupled approach can

71
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.125
lead to more accurate
localization,

72
00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:46.910
it's often tedious
to implement

73
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.105
and requires
a lot of tuning.

74
00:02:49.105 --> 00:02:50.915
For this reason,
we'll implement

75
00:02:50.915 --> 00:02:53.030
a loosely coupled
EKF here.

76
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.740
Here you can
see a graphical

77
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.210
representation
of our system.

78
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.080
We'll use the IMU
measurements as

79
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.360
noisy inputs to
our motion model.

80
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.350
This will give us

81
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.805
our predicted state
which will

82
00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:06.200
update every time we

83
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.445
have an IMU measurement,

84
00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:10.295
this can happen hundreds
of times a second.

85
00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:12.185
At a much slower rate,

86
00:03:12.185 --> 00:03:13.670
we'll incorporate GNSS

87
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.765
and LIDAR measurements

88
00:03:14.765 --> 00:03:16.510
whenever they
become available,

89
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.415
say once a second
or slower,

90
00:03:18.415 --> 00:03:19.370
and use them to

91
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.660
correct our
predicted state.

92
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.645
So, what is our state?
For our purposes,

93
00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:28.820
we'll use a ten-dimensional
state vector

94
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.744
that includes
a 3D position,

95
00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:32.365
a 3D velocity,

96
00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:34.640
any 4D unit
quaternion that will

97
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.990
represent
the orientation of

98
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.610
our vehicle with respect

99
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.785
to a navigation frame.

100
00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:42.230
We'll assume
that IMU outputs

101
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.450
specific forces and
rotational rates in

102
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.370
the sensor frame
and combine them

103
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.160
into a single
input vector u.

104
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.840
It's also important to

105
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.190
point out that
we're not going

106
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.235
to track accelerometer
or gyroscope biases.

107
00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.560
These are often put
into the state vector,

108
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.670
estimated, and
then subtracted

109
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.305
off of the our IMU
measurements.

110
00:04:01.305 --> 00:04:03.710
For clarity, we'll
emit them here

111
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.160
and assume

112
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.045
our IMU measurements
are unbiased.

113
00:04:07.045 --> 00:04:09.525
Our motion model
for the position,

114
00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:10.170
velocity,

115
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.990
and orientation
will integrate

116
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.370
the proper
accelerations and

117
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.500
rotational rates
from our IMU.

118
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.740
The position updates
look like this.

119
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.775
Next is the
velocity update,

120
00:04:21.775 --> 00:04:25.515
and finally,
the quaternion update.

121
00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.950
We'll need to use
a bunch of definitions

122
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.600
as shown below.

123
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.550
Remember that
our quaternion

124
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.050
will keep track of
the orientation

125
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.790
of our sensor frame S

126
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.665
with respect to
our navigation frame

127
00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:40.790
n. Because of the
orientation parameters,

128
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.845
which we express as
a rotation matrix,

129
00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:45.025
our motion model
is not linear.

130
00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:46.400
To use it in our EKF,

131
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.410
we'll need to linearize
it with respect to

132
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.210
some small error or

133
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.000
perturbation about
the predicted state.

134
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.800
To do this, we'll define

135
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.575
an error state that
consists of Delta P,

136
00:04:57.575 --> 00:05:00.020
Delta V, and
Delta phi where

137
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.040
Delta phi is a three

138
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.720
by one orientation error.

139
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.635
Using this state,
we can derive

140
00:05:06.635 --> 00:05:07.730
aerodynamics with the

141
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.920
appropriate Jacobians.

142
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.930
For our measurement model,

143
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.760
we'll use a very
simple observation of

144
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.930
the position plus

145
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.390
some additive
Gaussian noise.

146
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.380
We'll define
a covariance R sub GNSS,

147
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.710
for the GNSS
position noise,

148
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.770
and R sub LIDAR,

149
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.720
for our LIDAR position
measurement noise.

150
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.550
It's important here
to note that we have

151
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.020
assumed that our LIDAR and

152
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.645
GNSS will supply
position measurements

153
00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:38.170
in the same
coordinate frame.

154
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.550
In a realistic
implementation,

155
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.425
the GNSS position
estimates

156
00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:43.550
may serve as a way to

157
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.080
select a known map

158
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.430
against which
the LIDAR data

159
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.960
can then be compared.

160
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.760
With these
definitions in mind,

161
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.930
we can now describe

162
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.105
our extended
Kalman filter.

163
00:05:53.105 --> 00:05:55.160
Our filter will loop every

164
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.485
time an IMU
measurement occurs.

165
00:05:57.485 --> 00:05:59.900
We'll first use the
motion model to predict

166
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.360
a new state based
on our last state.

167
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.950
The last state may be

168
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.360
a fully corrected state

169
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.160
or one that was
also propagated

170
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.990
using the motion
model only

171
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.520
depending on
whether or not we

172
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.935
received a GNSS or
LIDAR measurement

173
00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:15.270
at the last time step.

174
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.320
Next, we'll propagate
the state uncertainty

175
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.345
through our linearized
motion model.

176
00:06:20.345 --> 00:06:22.415
Again, accounting
for whether or not

177
00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:23.690
our previous state was

178
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.855
corrected or uncorrected.

179
00:06:25.855 --> 00:06:27.900
At this point,
if we don't have

180
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.465
any GNSS or LIDAR
measurements available,

181
00:06:30.465 --> 00:06:32.790
we can repeat
steps one and two.

182
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.700
If we do, we'll
first compute

183
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.380
the Kalman gain
that is appropriate

184
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.110
for the given observation,

185
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.250
we'll then compute
an error state that we

186
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.560
will use to correct
our predicted state.

187
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.420
This error state
is based on

188
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.220
the product of
the Kalman gain and

189
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.540
the difference between the

190
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.715
predicted and
observed position.

191
00:06:49.715 --> 00:06:51.155
We will then correct

192
00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:54.095
our predicted state
using our error state.

193
00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:56.195
This correction is
straightforward

194
00:06:56.195 --> 00:06:57.950
for position and velocity,

195
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.780
but some more
complicated algebra is

196
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.050
required to correct
the quaternion.

197
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.130
We'll need
this special update

198
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.390
because the quaternion is

199
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.160
a constrained
quantity that

200
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.510
is not a simple vector.

201
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.660
Finally, we'll update

202
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.850
our state covariants
in the usual way.

203
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.730
That's it. There
you have it.

204
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.590
Your very own
localization pipeline.

205
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.360
If you followed everything

206
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.490
up until now,
congratulations!

207
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.900
You're well on your way to

208
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.150
becoming a
localization guru.

209
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.740
Before we end this lesson,

210
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.330
let's review a few of
the assumptions we've

211
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.270
made when putting
our pipeline together.

212
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.460
We used a loosely-coupled

213
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.155
extended Kalman
Filter framework

214
00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:37.610
to fuse inertial
measurements

215
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.350
from an IMU together with

216
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.880
position measurements
from a GNSS

217
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.350
receiver and LIDAR.

218
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.719
We assume that the GNSS

219
00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:46.940
and LIDAR provided us with

220
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.050
position estimates in

221
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.610
the same coordinate frame

222
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.335
which requires
some preprocessing,

223
00:07:51.335 --> 00:07:52.520
but is possible to do

224
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.565
in a realistic
implementation.

225
00:07:54.565 --> 00:07:56.840
Second, we did
not account for

226
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.909
accelerometer or
gyroscope biases

227
00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:00.410
in our IMU measurements.

228
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.300
This simplified
our algebra

229
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.520
but is not a
realistic assumption.

230
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.320
Luckily, if you follow

231
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.850
along with what
we've done here,

232
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.015
adding biases is not
insignificant leap.

233
00:08:11.015 --> 00:08:13.205
Next, we didn't discuss

234
00:08:13.205 --> 00:08:15.260
Filter State
initialization.

235
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.750
This is often taken to
be some known state

236
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.910
at the start of
the localization process.

237
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.970
Finally, we also

238
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.050
assumed that our
sensors were

239
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.445
all spatially and
temporally aligned.

240
00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:29.370
We assumed that
our sensors were

241
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.310
calibrated in the sense
that we didn't

242
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.360
worry about varying time

243
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.710
steps or how we can get

244
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.120
several sets of
measurements all

245
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.420
aligned into
one coordinate frame.

246
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.470
Performing
this latter step is

247
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.820
a very important part of

248
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.900
constructing an accurate

249
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.310
localization pipeline.

250
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.600
We'll discuss it next.
