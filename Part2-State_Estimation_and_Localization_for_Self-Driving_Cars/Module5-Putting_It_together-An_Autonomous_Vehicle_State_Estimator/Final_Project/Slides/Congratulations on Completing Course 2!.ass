00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.375
Congratulations on submitting
your course to final project.

2
00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.740
Hopefully, you were able to
produce an accurate estimate of

3
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.660
the vehicles trajectory using

4
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.735
the measurements from
the Carlo simulator.

5
00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:27.590
Now, you'll have a chance to compare

6
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.440
your implementation to
our project solution.

7
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.825
Let's start by looking
at the main loop

8
00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:35.480
inside the error state
extended Kalman filter.

9
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.190
In our solution, we're using

10
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.750
the non-linear motion model that we

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.600
defined in module five lesson two,

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.310
which takes the specific force and

13
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.350
rotational rates from our IMU as

14
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.315
inputs and outputs a state which
consists of pose and velocity.

15
00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:53.360
The inputs to the motion model
are provided by

16
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.525
the IMU measurements
available at every time step.

17
00:00:56.525 --> 00:00:58.490
Together with the pose and

18
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.730
velocity estimate at
the previous time step,

19
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.960
the model produces
an initial estimate of

20
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.075
the current state
that is a prediction.

21
00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:09.170
Next, we need to produce
an initial estimate of

22
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.695
the covariance or uncertainty
associated with this new state.

23
00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:16.310
Finally, we check whether they are

24
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.970
GNSS or lidar measurements
available at the current time step.

25
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.350
If there are measurements available,

26
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.809
we correct the pose
and velocity estimates

27
00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:30.310
and the associated covariance
or uncertainty matrix.

28
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.490
In the measurement update function,

29
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.710
we first determine the Kalman gain
as defined in module two using

30
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.870
the measurement model
Jacobian as well as

31
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.975
the state and
measurement covariances.

32
00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:46.655
The updated Kalman gain is then
used to calculate the error state,

33
00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:48.830
which corrects our current pose and

34
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.760
velocity estimates and
the filter covariance matrix.

35
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.100
The resulting trajectory estimate

36
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.860
can then be compared
to the ground truth.

37
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.005
Looking at the ground truth,

38
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:03.725
we can see that the vehicle
was following a curved path.

39
00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:07.495
Comparing the ground truth
trajectory to our estimate,

40
00:02:07.495 --> 00:02:09.770
we note that our estimate
remains close to

41
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.185
ground truth in
the x and y directions.

42
00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:15.425
Well, there are some significant
errors in the z-direction.

43
00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:17.330
Looking at the state errors and

44
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.670
the corresponding three sigma bonds,

45
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.730
we see that the largest errors
for all states appear within

46
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.040
the same time frame that coincides

47
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.875
with the large z-direction error
we noticed earlier.

48
00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:30.155
The dashed red lines represent

49
00:02:30.155 --> 00:02:33.140
three standard deviations
from the ground truth.

50
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.420
This gives an indication
as to how well

51
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.840
our estimator model fits
the actual dynamics of the vehicle,

52
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.110
and how well the estimator
is operating overall.

53
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.240
The state error should remain within

54
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.240
the three sigma bonds at all times.

55
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.550
There are other estimators
you could have

56
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.170
implemented to solve this problem,

57
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.545
like the vanilla UKF or the
uncentered Kalman filter.

58
00:02:54.545 --> 00:02:57.140
You're welcome to compare
these implementations to

59
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.425
the ESEKF and let us
know how they do.

60
00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:04.450
Again, congratulations on finishing
your course to File Project.

61
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.745
State estimation is a vital part of

62
00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:09.070
any self-driving car software stack.

63
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.900
Aside from GNSS and
lidar measurements,

64
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.740
many other sensors and
sources of information are

65
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.385
often used to produce reliable
estimates for self-driving cars.

66
00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:20.650
You'll learn more about
a very important sensor

67
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.870
in the next course of
this specialization,

68
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.380
the camera and how to use
it for visual perception.

69
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.630
Keep up the great work.
