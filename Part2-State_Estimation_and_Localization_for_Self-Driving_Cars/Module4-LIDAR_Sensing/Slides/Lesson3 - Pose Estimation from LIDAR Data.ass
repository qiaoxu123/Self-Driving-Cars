00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.650
Now that you've learned
how to translate,

2
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.685
rotate and scale point clouds,

3
00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.360
it's time to talk
about how we can

4
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.190
actually use these operations

5
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.990
with real point clouds to

6
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.545
estimate the motion of
a self-driving car.

7
00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:27.950
The way that we do this in

8
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.420
general is by solving something

9
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.060
called the point set
registration problem,

10
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.950
which is one of
the most important problems

11
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.260
in computer vision and
pattern recognition.

12
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.820
By the end of this video,

13
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.980
you'll be able to
describe the point set

14
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.720
registration problem and how

15
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.955
it can be used for
state estimation,

16
00:00:43.955 --> 00:00:47.555
describe and implement
the Iterative Closest Point

17
00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:50.975
or ICP algorithm for
point set registration,

18
00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:53.795
and understand some
common pitfalls of using

19
00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:58.080
ICP for state estimation
on self-driving cars.

20
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.810
Let's explore this problem by
returning to our example of

21
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.790
a self-driving car observing

22
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.985
a tree from a LIDAR
mounted on the cars roof.

23
00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:09.935
At time t equals one say,

24
00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:11.920
the LIDAR returns
a point cloud that

25
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.755
follows the contour of
the tree as before.

26
00:01:14.755 --> 00:01:16.990
The coordinates of every point

27
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.130
in the point cloud are given

28
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.150
relative to the pose of

29
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.755
the lidar at the time
of the scan,

30
00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:25.480
we'll call this
coordinate frame S. At

31
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.990
time t equals two the car is
driven a bit further ahead,

32
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.700
but the LIDAR can
still see the tree

33
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.650
and return a second point cloud

34
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.470
whose coordinates are again
specified relative to

35
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.530
the pose of the lidar
at time t equals two,

36
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.170
we'll call this
coordinate frame S prime.

37
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.725
Now, the point set
registration problems says,

38
00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:48.920
given 2 point clouds in
two different coordinate frames,

39
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.170
and with the knowledge
that they correspond to

40
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.070
or contain the same object
in the world,

41
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.050
how shall we align them to
determine how the sensor

42
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.410
must have moved
between the two scans?

43
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.050
More specifically,
we want to figure

44
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.060
out the optimal translation and

45
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.890
the optimal rotation between

46
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.930
the two sensor
reference frames that

47
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.515
minimizes the distance
between the 2 point clouds.

48
00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:15.790
We'll describe what we
mean by distance shortly.

49
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.425
To keep things simple,

50
00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:20.135
we're going to pretend that
we have an ideal LIDAR sensor

51
00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:23.300
that measures the entire point
cloud all at once,

52
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.575
so that we can ignore the
effects of motion distortion.

53
00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:30.800
Now, if we somehow knew that
each and every point in

54
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.930
the second point
cloud corresponded to

55
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.360
a specific point in
the first point cloud,

56
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.980
and we knew ahead of time

57
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.275
which points
corresponding to which,

58
00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:41.690
we could solve this
problem easily.

59
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.060
All we'd have to do is
find the translation and

60
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.855
rotation that lines up
each point with its twin.

61
00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:51.080
In this example,
our ideal rotation matrix

62
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.475
would be the identity matrix,

63
00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:54.460
that is no rotation at all,

64
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.000
and a ideal translation would be

65
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.505
along the cars forward direction.

66
00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:01.270
The problem is
that, in general we

67
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.130
don't know which points
correspond to each other.

68
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.200
In the course on computer vision,

69
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.450
you'll learn about
feature matching

70
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.860
which is one way of determining

71
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.400
correspondences between
points using cameraData.

72
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.640
But for now let's think
about how we might solve

73
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.200
this problem without knowing

74
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.225
any of the correspondences
ahead of time.

75
00:03:19.225 --> 00:03:20.800
The most popular algorithm for

76
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.330
solving this kind of
problem is called

77
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.845
the Iterative Closest Point
algorithm or ICP for short.

78
00:03:26.845 --> 00:03:30.595
The basic intuition
behind ICP is this,

79
00:03:30.595 --> 00:03:33.685
when we find the optimal
translation and rotation,

80
00:03:33.685 --> 00:03:36.400
or if we know something
about them in advance,

81
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.080
and we use them to transform

82
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.630
one point cloud into the
coordinate frame of the other,

83
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.310
the pairs of points that truly

84
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.140
correspond to each other will be

85
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.640
the ones that are closest to each

86
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.505
other in a Euclidean sense.

87
00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:51.620
This makes sense if you consider

88
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.780
the simplified case
where our LIDAR sensors

89
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.940
scans exactly the same points

90
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.465
just from two different
vantage points.

91
00:03:58.465 --> 00:04:00.530
In this case,
there's a one-to-one

92
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.810
mapping between points
in the two scans,

93
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.250
and this mapping is completely

94
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.965
determined by the motion
of the sensor.

95
00:04:06.965 --> 00:04:09.710
So, that's the ideal case
for when we found

96
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.190
the best possible
translation and rotation,

97
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.370
but what if we don't have

98
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.530
the optimal translation
and rotation,

99
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.710
how do we decide which points
actually go together?

100
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.035
Well, with ICP we use
a simple heuristic,

101
00:04:24.035 --> 00:04:26.300
and say that for
each point in one cloud,

102
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.700
the best candidate for
a corresponding point in

103
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.350
the other Cloud is the point

104
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.705
that is closest to it right now.

105
00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.940
The idea here is
that this heuristic

106
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.530
should give us
the correspondences that

107
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.255
let us make our next guess

108
00:04:38.255 --> 00:04:40.209
for the translation and rotation,

109
00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:43.265
that's a little bit better
than our current guess.

110
00:04:43.265 --> 00:04:45.935
As our guesses get
better and better,

111
00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:47.810
our correspondences should also

112
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.400
get better and better until we

113
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.055
eventually converge
to the optimal motion

114
00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:54.365
and the optimal correspondences.

115
00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:57.170
This iterative
optimization scheme using

116
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.460
the closest point heuristic
is where ICP gets its name.

117
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.860
It's important to
note that the word

118
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.170
closest implies that we
will find points that

119
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.180
lie close together after

120
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.015
applying the frame to
frame transformation only.

121
00:05:11.015 --> 00:05:12.620
That is, because the vehicle is

122
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.720
moving it's almost never the case

123
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.875
that a laser beam will hit

124
00:05:15.875 --> 00:05:19.380
exactly the same
surface point twice.

125
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.690
So, let's talk about the steps
in the ICP algorithm.

126
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.660
First and most
important is that we

127
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.360
need an initial guess
for the transformation.

128
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.850
We need this because
there's no guarantee that

129
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.545
the closest point heuristic will

130
00:05:33.545 --> 00:05:35.780
actually converge to
the best solution.

131
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.435
It's very easy to get
stuck in a local minimum

132
00:05:38.435 --> 00:05:40.895
in these kinds of
iterative optimization schemes.

133
00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:43.570
So, we'll need
a good starting guess.

134
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.745
Now, the initial guess can
come from a number of sources.

135
00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:48.560
One of the most
common sources for

136
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.990
robotics applications
like self-driving

137
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.490
is a motion model,

138
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.350
which could be
supplied by an IMU as

139
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.270
we saw in the
previous module or by

140
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.225
wheel odometry or
something really simple

141
00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:02.405
like a constant velocity or
even a zero velocity model.

142
00:06:02.405 --> 00:06:04.970
How complex the motion model
needs to be to give us

143
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.860
a good initial guess really

144
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.305
depends on how smoothly
the car is driving.

145
00:06:09.305 --> 00:06:11.150
If the car is moving
slowly relative

146
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.220
to the scanning rate
of the LIDAR sensor,

147
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.510
one may even use

148
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.760
the last known pose
as the initial guess.

149
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.780
For our example, let's say we use

150
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.160
a very noisy IMU and

151
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.250
emotion model to provide
the initial guess.

152
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.410
The model tells us that
the sensor translated

153
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.590
forward a bit and
also pitched upwards.

154
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.850
In step two, we'll use
this initial guess to transform

155
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.620
the coordinates of the points in

156
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.350
one cloud into the reference
frame of the other,

157
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.000
and then match each point in

158
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.450
the second cloud to the closest
point in the first cloud.

159
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.700
Here we've shown
the associations for

160
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.715
the first four points and
the last four points.

161
00:06:49.715 --> 00:06:52.100
Note that there's nothing
stopping two points in

162
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.600
one cloud from being
associated with

163
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.320
the same point in
the other cloud.

164
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.930
Step three is to take all of

165
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.600
those match points and find
the transformation that

166
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.980
minimizes the sum of

167
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.790
squared distances between
the corresponding points.

168
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.910
We'll talk about the math
behind this step in a minute,

169
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.620
but you can visualize
it as wrapping

170
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.890
an elastic band around
each pair of matched points,

171
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.840
and then letting go and
waiting for the system to

172
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.780
find its lowest
energy configuration.

173
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.780
The translation and
rotation associated with

174
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.775
this minimum energy configuration

175
00:07:24.775 --> 00:07:27.170
are the optimal solutions.

176
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.870
Then, we repeat the process
using the translation and

177
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.485
rotation we just solved for
as our new initial guess.

178
00:07:34.485 --> 00:07:38.295
We keep going until
the optimization converges.

179
00:07:38.295 --> 00:07:40.170
So in the next iteration,

180
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.110
we use the new translation
and rotation to transform

181
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.364
the point cloud and then
find the closest matches,

182
00:07:46.364 --> 00:07:48.750
solve for the optimal
transformation,

183
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.205
and keep going until we reach the

184
00:07:50.205 --> 00:07:53.070
optimum after a few iterations.

185
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.140
How do we actually solve for

186
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.915
the optimal transformation
in step three?

187
00:07:57.915 --> 00:08:00.300
Maybe you've already guessed
that we're going to use

188
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.195
our favorite tool, least-squares.

189
00:08:03.195 --> 00:08:05.940
Our goal here is to
find the rotation and

190
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.925
translation that best aligns
the two point clouds.

191
00:08:08.925 --> 00:08:12.060
Specifically, you want
to minimize the sum of

192
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.355
squared euclidean
distances between

193
00:08:14.355 --> 00:08:15.960
each pair of matched points,

194
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.430
which is one of the loss function

195
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.750
that we've defined here.

196
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.030
This least squares problem
is a little bit more

197
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.610
complex than the ones
we've encountered so far.

198
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.785
That's because
the rotation matrix

199
00:08:25.785 --> 00:08:28.125
is inside the loss function.

200
00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:30.330
It turns out the
rotation matrices

201
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.250
do not behave like vectors.

202
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.020
If you add two vectors together,

203
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.460
you get another vector.

204
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.875
But if you add two
rotation matrices together,

205
00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:41.475
the result is not necessarily
a valid rotation matrix.

206
00:08:41.475 --> 00:08:45.000
In reality, 3D rotations
belong to something called the

207
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.600
special orthogonal group or SO3.

208
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.330
We won't dig into what
that means in this course,

209
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.070
but it's important
to remember that

210
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.920
rotations needs
special treatment.

211
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.340
It turns out that there's
a nice closed form solution to

212
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.080
this least-squares
problem which was

213
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.360
discovered in the 1960s.

214
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.655
We won't go through
the derivation here,

215
00:09:05.655 --> 00:09:07.080
but the good news
is that there is

216
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.580
a simple four step algorithm

217
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.620
you can follow to
solve this problem.

218
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.810
The first two steps are easy.

219
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.745
First, we compute the centroid of

220
00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:16.470
each point cloud by taking

221
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.260
the average over
the coordinates of each point.

222
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.420
This is exactly like calculating

223
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.640
the center of mass in physics.

224
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.520
Second, we work at
a three-by-three matrix

225
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.100
capturing the spread of
the two point clouds.

226
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.980
You can think of this W matrix
as something like

227
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.010
an inertia matrix you might
encounter in mechanics.

228
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.590
The W matrix is the quantity
we are going to use

229
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.590
to estimate the optimal
rotation matrix.

230
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.810
Step three is actually finding

231
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.700
the optimal rotation matrix.

232
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.665
This step is the most complex,

233
00:09:46.665 --> 00:09:48.270
and it involves taking
something called

234
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:53.505
the singular value decomposition
or SVD of the W matrix.

235
00:09:53.505 --> 00:09:56.175
If you've never seen
the SVD before,

236
00:09:56.175 --> 00:09:58.245
this step might
look a bit magical.

237
00:09:58.245 --> 00:09:59.970
Let's spend a moment
talking about what

238
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.750
the singular value
decomposition actually does.

239
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.330
The SVD is a way of factorizing

240
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.210
a matrix into the product
of two unitary matrices,

241
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.525
U and V, and a diagonal matrix S,

242
00:10:12.525 --> 00:10:14.250
whose non-zero entries
are called the

243
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.010
singular values of
the original matrix.

244
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.100
There are several ways
to interpret the SVD.

245
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.980
But for us, it's easiest
to think about U and V as

246
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.730
rotations and the S matrix
as a scaling matrix.

247
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.110
Since we're dealing with rigid

248
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.670
body motion in this problem,

249
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.790
we don't want any scaling
in a rotation estimate,

250
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.040
so we'll replace
the S matrix with something

251
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.530
like the identity matrix
to remove the scaling.

252
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.570
There's a trick though
in the way we choose

253
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.930
the bottom-right entry of
the new scaling matrix.

254
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.670
It turns out that in some cases,

255
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.900
the SVD will give us

256
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.230
rotation matrices that
are not proper rotations.

257
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.580
That is, they also have

258
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.730
a reflection about
the axis of rotation.

259
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.654
To make sure that we
get a proper rotation,

260
00:10:56.654 --> 00:10:58.860
we choose the bottom
right term to be

261
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.830
the product of
the determinants of U and

262
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.830
V. This number will be either

263
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:09.310
plus one or minus one and will
cancel out any reflection.

264
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.180
Once we have this,
all we have to do is

265
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.265
multiply out the three matrices.

266
00:11:14.265 --> 00:11:17.505
This gives us back
the optimal rotation matrix.

267
00:11:17.505 --> 00:11:20.055
Now, that we have
our rotation estimate,

268
00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:22.710
the last step is to
recover the translation.

269
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.170
This part is very
straightforward and only

270
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.390
involves rotating the centroid of

271
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.400
one point cloud into
the reference frame

272
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.560
of the other and then
taking the difference of

273
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.300
the coordinate vectors to find

274
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.560
the translation that will best

275
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.375
align the two point clouds.

276
00:11:36.375 --> 00:11:38.610
One other important thing
to think about,

277
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.100
both from a safety standpoint
and when we start

278
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.930
talking about sensor fusion
in a later module,

279
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.680
is how confident we should be in

280
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.005
the output of the ICP algorithm.

281
00:11:48.005 --> 00:11:49.940
There are a number
of different ways to

282
00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.500
estimate the uncertainty or

283
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.910
the covariance of
the estimated motion parameters.

284
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.075
An accurate and
relatively simple method

285
00:11:57.075 --> 00:11:59.530
is to use this equation here.

286
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.610
This expression tells us
how the covariance of

287
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.500
the estimated motion parameters

288
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.120
is related to the covariance

289
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.300
of the measurements in
the two point clouds using

290
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.040
certain second-order
derivatives of

291
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.140
the least squares cost function.

292
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.560
While its expression is
accurate and fast to compute,

293
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.090
it's a little tricky to derive

294
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.980
these second-order
derivatives when there's

295
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.280
a constraint quantity like
a rotation matrix in the mix.

296
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.550
For our purposes, we're
generally going to hand tune

297
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:30.945
the ICP covariance matrix to
give us acceptable results.

298
00:12:30.945 --> 00:12:33.885
You've now seen
the basic vanilla algorithm

299
00:12:33.885 --> 00:12:35.955
for the iterative
closest point method,

300
00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.640
but it's not the only way
of solving a problem.

301
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.130
In fact, this algorithm is

302
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.775
just one variant of ICP
called Point-to-point ICP,

303
00:12:44.775 --> 00:12:46.230
which derives its name from

304
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.880
the fact that
our objective function or

305
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.160
loss function
minimizes the distance

306
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.130
between pairs of
corresponding points.

307
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.200
Another popular variant that

308
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.880
works well in unstructured
environments like

309
00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.140
cities or indoors is
called Point-to-plain ICP.

310
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.910
Instead of minimizing
the distance

311
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.590
between pairs of points,

312
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.270
we fit a number of planes to

313
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.000
the first point cloud and
then minimize the distance

314
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.080
between each point in

315
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.460
the second cloud and

316
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.830
its closest plane
in the first cloud.

317
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.780
These planes could
represent things

318
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.955
like walls or road surfaces.

319
00:13:17.955 --> 00:13:19.710
The challenging part
of the algorithm is

320
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.755
actually figuring out
where all the planes are.

321
00:13:22.755 --> 00:13:25.695
We won't talk about how
to do this in detail,

322
00:13:25.695 --> 00:13:27.660
but you can check out
the documentation for

323
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.040
Point-to-plain ICP in

324
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.260
the point cloud library
for more information.

325
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.345
Now, up until this point,

326
00:13:36.345 --> 00:13:37.740
we've been assuming
that the objects

327
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.970
seen by our LIDAR are

328
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.510
stationary. What
if they're moving?

329
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.840
A common example of this is
if our car is driving in

330
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.505
traffic down a busy highway

331
00:13:47.505 --> 00:13:49.965
and scanning the vehicle
in front of it.

332
00:13:49.965 --> 00:13:53.400
Both vehicles are traveling
at the same speed while

333
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.900
our self-driving car is happily

334
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.430
collecting LIDAR data points.

335
00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.630
We ask ourselves again,

336
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.725
what motion of the car best
aligns the two point clouds?

337
00:14:04.725 --> 00:14:07.545
The answer we get is that
we haven't moved at all.

338
00:14:07.545 --> 00:14:09.315
But, of course, we did move,

339
00:14:09.315 --> 00:14:13.080
just not relative to the vehicle
directly ahead of us.

340
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.215
This is obviously
a contrived example.

341
00:14:16.215 --> 00:14:18.480
In reality, the point
cloud would also include

342
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.850
many stationary
objects like roads,

343
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.635
and buildings, and trees.

344
00:14:22.635 --> 00:14:25.650
But naively using ICP in
the presence of moving

345
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.810
objects will tend
to pull our motion

346
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.030
estimates away from
the true motion.

347
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.870
So we need to be
careful to exclude or

348
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.150
mitigate the effects of
outlying points that

349
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.240
violate our assumptions
of a stationary world.

350
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.270
One way to do this is
by fusing ICP motion

351
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.315
estimates with GPS
and INS estimates.

352
00:14:45.315 --> 00:14:48.930
We'll talk about how to do
this later in the course.

353
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.860
Another option is to identify
and ignore moving objects,

354
00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.590
which we could do with some
of the computer vision

355
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.785
techniques you'll learn
about in the next course.

356
00:14:57.785 --> 00:15:00.320
But an even simpler
approach for dealing

357
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.030
with outliers like these is to

358
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.725
choose a different loss function

359
00:15:03.725 --> 00:15:05.210
that is less sensitive to

360
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.635
large errors induced by

361
00:15:06.635 --> 00:15:10.220
outliers than our standard
squared error loss.

362
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.290
The class of loss functions

363
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.730
that have this
property are called

364
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.345
Robust Loss Functions or
robust cost functions,

365
00:15:17.345 --> 00:15:19.520
and there are several
to choose from.

366
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.650
We can write this
out mathematically

367
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.330
by generalizing our least squares

368
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.775
loss function so that
the contribution of

369
00:15:25.775 --> 00:15:29.210
each error is not simply
the square of its magnitude,

370
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.180
but rather, some
other function rho.

371
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.880
Some popular choices for
robust loss functions

372
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.930
include the Absolute
error or L1 norm,

373
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.615
the Cauchy loss, and
the Huber loss shown here.

374
00:15:41.615 --> 00:15:43.190
The key difference is that

375
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:44.870
the slope of the
loss function does

376
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.395
not continue to increase as
the errors become larger,

377
00:15:48.395 --> 00:15:51.785
but rather, it remains
constant or it tapers off.

378
00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:53.720
Robust loss functions make

379
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.750
the ICP problems slightly
more difficult because we can

380
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.840
no longer derive
a nice closed form solution

381
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.615
for the point cloud
alignment step,

382
00:16:01.615 --> 00:16:03.170
and this means we need to add

383
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:07.700
another iterative optimization
step inside our main loop.

384
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.930
However, the benefits cannot
weigh the added complexity.

385
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.870
To recap, the Iterative
Closest Point

386
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.240
or ICP algorithm is
a way to determine

387
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.340
the motion of
a self-driving car by

388
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.975
aligning point clouds from
LIDAR or other sensors.

389
00:16:22.975 --> 00:16:25.640
ICP works by iteratively

390
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.680
minimizing the Euclidean
distance between

391
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.005
neighboring points
in each point cloud

392
00:16:30.005 --> 00:16:32.435
which is where the algorithm
gets its name.

393
00:16:32.435 --> 00:16:35.720
Moving objects can be
a problem for ICP since they

394
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.940
violate the stationary
world assumption

395
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.280
that ICP is based on.

396
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.380
Outlier measurements like these

397
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.700
can be mitigated with a number

398
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.625
of techniques including
Robust Loss Functions,

399
00:16:46.625 --> 00:16:48.230
which assign less weight to

400
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.320
large errors than
the usual squared error loss.

401
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:56.330
Let's recap what we
learned in this module.

402
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.610
LIDAR or Light Detection and

403
00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.260
Ranging is a way of measuring

404
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.000
distances by observing the time

405
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.875
of flight of laser pulses.

406
00:17:03.875 --> 00:17:06.110
2D and 3D LIDAR sensors can

407
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:09.320
scan large swaths of
the environment around the car,

408
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.045
and the collection of
points returned from

409
00:17:11.045 --> 00:17:13.640
each scan is stored
as a point cloud,

410
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.140
which can be manipulated using

411
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.390
standard spatial operations such

412
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.000
as translation,
rotation, and scaling.

413
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.790
These operations are
an important part of

414
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.865
the Iterative Closest
Point or ICP algorithm,

415
00:17:25.865 --> 00:17:27.860
which is one common
technique for using

416
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:31.200
LIDAR to localize
a self-driving car.

417
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.330
In the next module,

418
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.970
we'll discuss
some practical aspects of

419
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.370
state estimation and talk
about how we can use

420
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.895
LIDAR and ICP in conjunction
with other sensors like

421
00:17:40.895 --> 00:17:43.040
IMUs and GPS to get

422
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.700
an accurate and reliable state
estimate for the vehicle.
